00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,918
On the last evening
of my 25th college reunion,

3
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:43,902
there was a party in a tent

4
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:48,123
with dancing, and music, and noise.

5
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:52,262
So much noise that a lot of us
started to drift out of the tent

6
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:55,393
so we could hear each other talk
and catch up with classmates

7
00:00:55,394 --> 00:00:57,864
that we had not seen
in more than 2 decades.

8
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:02,855
As I talked with my friends
I made an astounding discovery:

9
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:07,796
80% of them were unhappy with their lives.

10
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:14,956
"I feel as though I've wasted my life,
and I'm half way through it," they said.

11
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:17,626
"I don't know what my life is all about."

12
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,938
I was privileged to go to Yale,

13
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,184
and we were standing on a summer evening
in the middle of Yale's old campus,

14
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:32,007
and the people that I was speaking with
were privileged, and highly educated,

15
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,828
and financially well off,
and in positions of power.

16
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,460
And they had the first house,
and the second house,

17
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:43,016
and they had the first spouse,
and the second spouse.

18
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:44,989
(Laughter)

19
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,919
And 80% of them
were unhappy with their lives.

20
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,218
Who was happy, the 20%?

21
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:57,290
Well, we had studied literature
and Renaissance rhetoric,

22
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,862
and we were the theater people,
and the history geeks.

23
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:05,321
We had studied classes
for the joy of learning,

24
00:02:05,322 --> 00:02:09,947
not because we thought they were going
to put direct us to a specific job.

25
00:02:09,948 --> 00:02:11,485
We still got jobs,

26
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:14,666
we were living our lives expansively,

27
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,613
with life's ups and downs,

28
00:02:16,614 --> 00:02:21,733
and we did not feel
that we had wasted a single minute.

29
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:26,005
And as I spoke
with the 20%, the happier 20%,

30
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:28,951
I discovered that each of them knew

31
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:31,512
something about their life purpose

32
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:34,022
because they knew five things:

33
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:38,012
who they were, what they did,

34
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:39,988
who they did it for,

35
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,477
what those people wanted or needed,

36
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:46,558
and what they got out of it,
how they changed as a result.

37
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:48,815
Does that sound hard?

38
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:50,966
It's not, it's actually really simple.

39
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:56,967
In fact it's so simple, that you can learn
your life purpose now.

40
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,208
You're going to know your life
purpose now, in the next five minutes.

41
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,348
Would you like to know your life purpose
in the next five minutes?

42
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,322
(Audience) Yes.

43
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:05,939
Can you be a little bit louder?

44
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,379
Because they are making
a lot of noise in the tent,

45
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,878
and there is just a silly little microphone
next to my cheek to hear you.

46
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,025
Would you like to know your life purpose
in the next five minutes?

47
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,119
(Audience) Yes!

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,229
Thank you. Actually, it's not
even going to take five minutes.

49
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:21,727
So, can I share something else with you?

50
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,162
If you're like a lot of us,

51
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:27,160
you have wondered and worried
about your life purpose for a long time,

52
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:31,100
and there are books, and magazines,
and workshops, and seminars about it.

53
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:37,790
In fact, Amazon lists 151,928 books

54
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:41,913
that refer to how you can learn
your life purpose.

55
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:43,014
(Laughter)

56
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:46,492
Well, I know some people
who have spent their entire lives

57
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,513
trying to learn their life purpose.

58
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:52,932
Look, we can all agree that
the unexamined life is not worth living,

59
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:57,497
but if all you're doing
is examining, you're not living.

60
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:58,742
(Laughter)

61
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:02,668
So, let's figure out
the life purpose right now together:

62
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:06,400
who you are, what you do,
who you do it for,

63
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:10,832
what those people want and need,
and how they change as a result.

64
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,355
Shall we do it?
(Audience) Yes.

65
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:13,330
All right.

66
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:16,209
Everybody, on the count of five,
shout out your first name.

67
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,959
One, two, three, four, five:

68
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:19,261
(Audience shouts)

69
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:20,103
Fabulous.

70
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:22,198
That was the first one, only four to go.

71
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,479
That's who you are. (Laughter)

72
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:25,937
Now, what do you do?

73
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:27,957
What do you love to do?

74
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,902
Do you love to write, cook, design,

75
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:38,060
create iOS apps, write code,
crunch numbers, talk, teach?

76
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:39,504
What do you love to do?

77
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:41,956
And if there is a lot of things
that come up for you

78
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:45,478
focus it down by asking
yourselves this one question:

79
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,233
what is the one thing that right now

80
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:52,227
you feel supremely qualified
to teach other people?

81
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:54,148
Think about that in one word.

82
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:56,696
Hold it. Don't release it yet.
On the count of five.

83
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,036
What do you do?

84
00:04:58,037 --> 00:05:00,964
One, two, three, four, five:

85
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:02,475
(Audience shouts)

86
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:04,094
Great. That's what you do.

87
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,824
Now, think about who you do it for,
picture them in your mind,

88
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:09,731
be ready to say it on the count of five.

89
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:11,255
Hold it, don't release it yet.

90
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:13,502
One, two, three, four, five:

91
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:15,152
(Audience murmurs)

92
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:17,701
OK, who do you do it for,
let's see it one more time.

93
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:20,447
A little bit louder, please,
over the people in the tent.

94
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:22,034
Who do you do it for? Together:

95
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:23,499
(Audience shouts)

96
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,265
Thank you. That is the spirit
that we need. OK, now.

97
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:28,267
What do all those people want or need?

98
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:30,183
What do they want or need that you have,

99
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:32,877
that they've come to you
so you can give them this thing.

100
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:35,322
What do they want or need?
In just one or two words.

101
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:36,762
Hold it, don't release it yet.

102
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:40,413
And on the count of five:
one, two, three, four, five...

103
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:41,544
(Audience shouts)

104
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:43,585
Fantastic. Now, this is the best one.

105
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:45,258
How do they change?

106
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:49,759
How do they change or transform
as a result of what you give them?

107
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,038
On the count of five,

108
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,423
how do they change or transform
as a result of what you give them?

109
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:57,361
One, two, three, four, five:

110
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:59,471
(Audience shouts)

111
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:03,273
Terrific. Now we're going to put this
all together kind of in a sentence, OK?

112
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:06,196
Everyone together,
louder than the people in the tent:

113
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:07,465
who are you?

114
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:08,667
(Audience responds)

115
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,301
What do you do?

116
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:11,461
(Audience responds)

117
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,028
Who do you do it for?

118
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:14,507
(Audience responds)

119
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,257
What do they want or need?

120
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:17,372
(Audience responds)

121
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:18,932
How do they change as a result?

122
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:19,893
(Audience responds)

123
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:20,613
Fantastic.

124
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,502
You have all just done something

125
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:26,109
that people who went to Yale
could not figure out for 25 years.

126
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,922
Congratulations. Give yourselves
a hand. (Applause)

127
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:33,432
Now, why is that formulation so powerful?

128
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:36,218
Because of all of those five things
that you need to know

129
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:37,993
to know what your life purpose is,

130
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:40,493
only two are about yourself.

131
00:06:40,494 --> 00:06:43,520
The other three of them
are about other people:

132
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:46,509
who they are, what they want or need,

133
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,554
and how they change as a result.

134
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:53,460
That formulation forces you
to be outward facing.

135
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:56,520
And all the happier people
that I met outside the tent

136
00:06:56,521 --> 00:06:58,476
on that warm New Haven night

137
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:01,175
they were outward facing,
they were not inward facing.

138
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:05,659
They knew very clearly whom they served,
what those people needed,

139
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,264
and how those people changed as a result.

140
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:10,121
And you may have intuited this already

141
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:15,508
that the most successful people
in any field always focus most

142
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,783
on the people that they serve
than on how they are served themselves.

143
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:25,534
Happier people make it a point
to make other people happy,

144
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:30,508
and do things that make them
feel well taken care of and secure.

145
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,498
If you make other people happy,
life teaches us,

146
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:35,764
we will be taken care of, too.

147
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:39,959
So since you all did so well, we have time
for just a little bit of extra credit.

148
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,101
(Laughter)

149
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:42,725
One of the most difficult things

150
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:45,375
that happens when you meet
people for the first time is

151
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:47,510
they ask you this question,

152
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,680
"So, what do you do?"

153
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:51,544
And, if you're like some of us,

154
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:53,839
that's a really
challenging question sometimes.

155
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,628
Particularly, if you're in these moments
where you're between things,

156
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:00,937
or you're feeling vulnerable,
or it isn't defined.

157
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,604
Or, what you seem to do
isn't what you really do,

158
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:08,055
or what you paid to do
isn't how you define yourself.

159
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,889
So, when people ask you
this question, "So, what do you do?"

160
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,378
and also, you've got
this mental monologue going on,

161
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:16,078
"Why is he asking me?
So, what do I do? Is it because..."

162
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,537
It's that transactional thing
where it's like: "He wants to know

163
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:21,695
if he should really
spend time talking to me?"

164
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:22,719
(Laughter)

165
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,719
Or, it's that other thing,
so he can tell me what he does

166
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,024
because he's sure it's, "Oh, really,
so much better than what I do?"

167
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:29,776
(Laughter)

168
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:30,747
Right?

169
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:34,246
So, when somebody asks you
that question, here's what you do:

170
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:37,503
you just say the very last thing
you called out,

171
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:40,989
how what you do changes
the people you do it for.

172
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:47,959
So, for example, you might say,
"I give kids awesome dreams."

173
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:52,897
If your life purpose is:
"I write books for children,

174
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:57,916
so they can fall asleep at night,
so they can have awesome dreams."

175
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:02,206
Or you might say: "I help people
look and feel their best,"

176
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,280
if your life purpose is:

177
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:08,625
"I design apparel for men and women
who need affordable choices,

178
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:11,839
so they can look and feel their best."

179
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,449
Or you might say: "I help people
get great work into the world,"

180
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,881
if your life purpose is:

181
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:24,403
"I train entrepreneurs and creative people
to take decisive actions,

182
00:09:24,404 --> 00:09:27,308
so they can get
their greatest work into the world."

183
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,248
And then,

184
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:33,248
that little snippet that you just said

185
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,935
becomes your personal elevator pitch.

186
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:37,997
And it will always start a conversation

187
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:40,335
because the person
that you were just talking to

188
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:41,705
has to ask you a question,

189
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,392
"How do you give kids great dreams?"

190
00:09:44,393 --> 00:09:47,440
"How do you help people
look and feel their best?"

191
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:51,285
"Can people really get
their greatest work into the world?"

192
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:54,137
And then you get to tell them,

193
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:58,431
and you get to share your life purpose.

194
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:02,452
And you get to share
how they may come to learn theirs, too.

195
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:05,043
(Applause)
