1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,150
Well I'll tell you a couple of strange things that the things that I don't really understand the first is when we've done the analysis

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,449
Of the effects of the future authoring program it has had a different

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,660
It's differential impact on men and it's had a particularly

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:19,799
differential impact on what I would call excluded men, and so that would be non-western ethnic minority men or

5
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:21,820
or

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,050
What?

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,550
Majority, man who are doing very well so for example at Mohawk College

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,840
The future authoring program had a particularly robust effect on

9
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:34,319
Mohawk College students who were men who hadn't done very well in high school

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,259
And who hadn't picked a major that had a destination a career destination at its end

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,689
so you can imagine those people are they have an ambiguous relationship with the idea of education and

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,339
They're not oriented specifically towards a goal. They're not very motivated

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,749
Now why did it have a differential effect on men?

14
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:57,449
That's a good question

15
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,340
Well first of all the women are doing better

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,010
so

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,369
It might just be a matter of the fact that it does better for people who aren't doing as well and at the moment most

18
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:06,090
Of them are men

19
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,070
I don't believe I think that might be part of it, but I don't believe that's all of it

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,479
I think that part of the reason that women are doing better is cuz they're agreeable and

21
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:20,008
So if a system sets out a structure and says here's a pathway to attainment

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,599
The women won't rebel against that they'll go along with it and that's working very well for them at the moment

23
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:27,899
the men especially the men on the disagreeable end of the distribution

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,909
And there's way more men on the district disagreeable end of the distribution, then there are women right

25
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,809
That's what you get from if you look at overlapping normal distributions, so there's the male district female distribution for agreeableness

26
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,500
male distribution for agreeableness tremendous overlap

27
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:49,799
Okay, women are higher all the really agreeable people are women all the really disagreeable people are men

28
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:57,269
And maybe the real differences occur at the extremes right so so and it's it's a very interesting side effect of overlapping

29
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,850
Distributions, so they people can be mostly the same

30
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,229
But that can still produce

31
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,229
radical differences

32
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,540
Disagreeable men won't do anything they don't want to do

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,979
They just say up yours I'll go home and play video games

34
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,860
With you no. I'm not listening to your stupid and

35
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,249
Why should I work for you? I'll just go have fun

36
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,230
I'll do my own thing

37
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,989
I don't think they're motivated and so then if you take the men who are like that and you say, okay. What do you want?

38
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,880
You can have what you want

39
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,480
But you have to figure out what it is

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,509
So then they write down what they want they think oh hey well that might be worth having so maybe I'll put some effort into

41
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,939
It that's what it looks like to me now

42
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,809
You know that's weak evidence, and this is a weak argument, but I'm trying to stretch out my understanding to account for this

43
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,560
But I'll tell you something else that's really weird. I don't understand this either, so

44
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,810
More than 90% of the people who watch my videos on YouTube are men now

45
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:59,369
that's weird because not about 80% of psychology students are women so that is not what you would expect right you would expect that the

46
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,799
Majority of them would be women and you might say well

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,559
it's because of the political stance I've taken and I thought well that's possible so I went looked at the demographic data because I have

48
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,290
That well before I did any of the political videos

49
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:17,910
85% of my viewers were men so it's actually increased a bit, it's increased by 6% and that's not trivial

50
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,160
But it was still overwhelmingly men, so that was interesting. I thought what the hell

51
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,109
why is that exactly and then now I've been watching crowds when I've been talking to them and

52
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,480
The crowds that have come to see me in person this happened at the University of Toronto free speech debate

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,470
and I actually noticed it and

54
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,369
Commented on it before the debate took place because I was talking about intrinsic differences between men and women and I looked around the room

55
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,520
And I thought hmm hey 80% of the people in this room are men

56
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,330
So I had all the men's women and women stand up and then all the men stand up

57
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,059
I said look like here's a natural experiment

58
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,140
For some reason 80% of the people who showed up to this or men now everybody thought

59
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,169
I was kind of cracked to to do that and it was a risk

60
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,559
You know what and all right, but I thought no weather something going on here

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,940
And then what's interesting now is that every public appearance that I've made that's related to the sort of topics that we're discussing is

62
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,520
Overwhelmingly men it's like it's like

63
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:12,880
85 to 90%

64
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,839
And so I thought wow that's weird like what the hell's going on here exactly, and then the other thing. I've noticed is that?

65
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,369
I've been talking a lot to the crowds that I've been talking to not about rights

66
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:30,180
But about responsibility right because he can't have the bloody. What are you doing? You can't have the conversation about rights without the

67
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,140
conversation about responsibility because your rights are my

68
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,619
Responsibility that's what they are technically so you just can't have only half of that discussion

69
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,890
And we're only having half that discussion and the question is well

70
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:50,009
What the hell are you leaving out if you only have that half of the discussion and the answer is what you're leaving out

71
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,710
Responsibility and then the question is well

72
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,169
What are you leaving out if you're leaving out responsibility and the answer might be well, maybe you're leaving out the meaning of life

73
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,829
That's what it looks like to me. It's like here you are

74
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,999
Suffering away, what makes it worthwhile, right?

75
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,820
you know you're completely out you're completely you have no idea what you're

76
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,729
You it's almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is

77
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,100
Responsibility

78
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,840
That's what gives life meaning

79
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
It's like lift a load

80
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,320
Then you can tolerate yourself right because look at your useless

81
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,309
Easily hurt easily killed. Why should you have any self-respect?

82
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,980
That's the story of the fall

83
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,809
Pick something up and carry it pick make it heavy enough so that you can think yeah well

84
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,489
Useless as I am at least I could move that from there to there well

85
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:51,150
What's really cool about that is that when I talk to these crowds about this the man's eyes light up, and that's very good

86
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,369
I've seen that phenomena because I've been talking about this mythological material for a long time and I can see when I'm watching crowds people

87
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:03,360
You know their eyebrows lift their eyes let light up because I put something together for them. That's what mythological stories

88
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,460
Do so I'm not taking responsibility for that

89
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,999
That's what the stories do so I save the story people go click click click

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,210
You know in their eyes light up, but this responsibility thing

91
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,589
That's a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that it is unbelievable

92
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,219
And one of the things I've been talking to some of the people who've been

93
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,969
Running for the conservative leadership in Canada, and I've been talking to them about well the difficulties

94
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,220
They have communicating with young people because conservatives

95
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,830
What what the hell are they going to sell to young people right because being conservative is something that happens when you're older they can

96
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,830
sell responsibility

97
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,309
No, one's selling it and the thing is for men. There's nothing about responsibility

98
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:44,189
You know I was watching The Simpsons the other day

99
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,989
I watched the first Simpsons episode

100
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:51,689
And I deconstructed it and so it's really interesting so what happens in the first Simpson episode is that?

101
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:58,049
It's Christmas and homer and Marge are going to buy some Christmas presents, but Homer doesn't get his Christmas bonus

102
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,050
And so he's absolutely crushed by that and that

103
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,139
Actually is a recurring theme in The Simpsons where Homer loses his job or something like that or can tonight make enough money

104
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:10,438
He's completely crushed even though he's kind of useless bumbling

105
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:17,429
Laughing fool of a guy. You know the thing that gives that show its soul is that he's still oriented towards his family

106
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,439
That's what makes him honorable is that?

107
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,528
Foolish as he is he's decided to adopt

108
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:27,359
Responsibility for his family and to try to bear that and so he's not he's a holy fool

109
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,469
He's not a complete fool

110
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:35,939
And it's so interesting watching the story because he suffers dreadfully as a consequence of not being able to fulfill his responsibilities well

111
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,239
That's for men

112
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,768
Women have their sets of responsibilities. They're not the same

113
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:45,449
Right because they're complicated because women of course have to take primary

114
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:52,378
Responsibility for for having infants at least but then also for caring for them there they're structured differently than men

115
00:07:53,259 --> 00:08:00,748
For biological necessity even if it's not a psychological issue and it's also partly a psychological issue women know what they have to do

116
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:07,619
men have to figure out what they have to do, and if they have nothing worth living for then they stay Peter Pat and

117
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:10,289
Why the hell not?

118
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,818
because the alternative to valued responsibility is

119
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,219
Impulsive

120
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:19,329
low-class

121
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:24,269
Pleasure and you saw that in the Pinocchio story right that's Pleasure Island, it's like well

122
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,609
Why lift the load if there's nothing in it for you?

123
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:31,828
That's another thing that we're doing to men. That's a very bad idea and to boys it's like

124
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,479
You're pathological and oppressive. It's like fine. Then why the hell am I going to play

125
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,438
That's that if that's the situation if I get no credit for bearing responsibility

126
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,349
It could bloody well be sure I'm not going to bear it

127
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:49,739
but then you know your life is useless and meaningless and you have you're not you're full of self-contempt and nihilism and and

128
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,948
That's not good, and so that's why I think all right

129
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,390
That's what I think's going

130
00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:00,269
At a deeper level with regards to men needing this direction a man has to decide that he's going to do something

131
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,659
He has to decide that yeah, well. You know partly what you're trying to do in the future authoring processes say, okay well

132
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,079
What's your highest value?

133
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:14,969
Right it's the star. It's like. Okay. What are you aiming for you can decide man, but you know there's some criteria

134
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,550
It should be good for you. It should be good for you in a way that facilitates your moving forward

135
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,649
Maybe it should be good for you in a way. That's also good for the family in the community it should cover the the

136
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:34,350
domain of life I mean there's constraints on what you should regard as a value, but you but within those constraints you have the

137
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,319
Choice you have choice

138
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,749
Well the thing is is that people will carry a heavy load if they get to pick the goddamn load

139
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,140
So and they think well I won't carry any load

140
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,310
It's like okay fine

141
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,429
But then you're like the sled dog that doesn't have a sled to pull you're just gonna

142
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,269
You're gonna tear pieces out of your own legs because you're bored. You know you need people are pack animals

143
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:02,279
They need they need to pull against a weight, and and that's not true for everyone

144
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:08,729
it's not true particularly say for low conscientious people I mean maybe they're open and creative or extroverted and some other things but for the

145
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
for the typical person

146
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:18,209
They'll eat themselves they'll eat themselves up unless they have a load this is why there's such an opiate epidemic among

147
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,359
Dispossessed white middle-aged guys who are unemployed in the u.s.. It's like they lose their job. They're done

148
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:32,490
Right they despise themselves. They develop chronic pain syndromes and depression and the chronic pain is treated with opiates

149
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,490
It's like that's what we're doing so

150
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,699
Yeah, that's what it looks like to me is you you have to and it's so interesting to watch the young men when you talk

151
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:49,439
To them about responsibility, there's a god damn thrilled about it. It just blows me away. It's like really. That's what's that's the counterculture

152
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,690
Grow the hell up and do something useful really I could do that oh

153
00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:01,169
