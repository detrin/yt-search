1
00:00:06,097 --> 00:00:08,922
Questioner: What’s… what’s for me the purpose of life,

2
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:11,975
if you can give an insight on that?

3
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,432
Thank you.

4
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:21,868
Sadhguru: Isn't it fantastic that if there is no purpose,

5
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:22,884
you have nothing to fulfill,

6
00:00:22,884 --> 00:00:24,427
you can just live?

7
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:27,291
Hmm?

8
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:27,860
No,

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,064
but you want a purpose

10
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:34,350
and not a simple purpose, you want a God-given purpose. (Laughter)

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,342
It's very dangerous.

12
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:38,762
People who think they have a God-given purpose

13
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:42,472
are doing the cruelest things on the planet.

14
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:44,805
Yes or no?

15
00:00:44,805 --> 00:00:47,101
They are doing the most horrible things

16
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:50,435
and they’ve always been doing the most horrible things

17
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:53,505
because when you have a God-given purpose,

18
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:58,430
life here becomes less important than your purpose.

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,353
No,

20
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:02,810
life is important.

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,324
Life is important -

22
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:05,944
when I say life,

23
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:12,060
I am not talking about your family, your work, what you do, what you do not do, you party

24
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,132
I am not talking about that as life.

25
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:17,714
This is life, isn't it?

26
00:01:17,714 --> 00:01:20,476
Life is within you or around you?

27
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:25,233
The… the ambiance of life

28
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:28,872
you’re mistaking the ambiance of life for life.

29
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:34,081
Your home, your family, your workspace, your party

30
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:36,342
this is all ambiance of life.

31
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:38,595
This is not life, isn't it?

32
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:39,559
Yes or no?

33
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:40,582
Participants: Yes.

34
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:43,738
Sadhguru: You’re mistaking the ambiance for the real thing.

35
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:45,060
No.

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,458
Life is important

37
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,469
because it's the only thing you know,

38
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:50,782
you don't know anything else.

39
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:53,427
Do you know something else?

40
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:55,468
Rest is all imagined stuff, isn't it?

41
00:01:55,468 --> 00:02:00,650
The only thing is that this is beating and alive and that's all there is.

42
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,277
So, is this important?

43
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:04,998
It is of paramount importance.

44
00:02:07,248 --> 00:02:10,970
Not you as a person, that’s not important,

45
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,643
but you as a piece of life

46
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:14,922
it’s very important

47
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:17,352
because that is the basis of everything.

48
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:19,729
When I say that is the basis of everything,

49
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:24,097
the universe exists for you only because you are, isn't it?

50
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:25,865
Yes or no?

51
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:28,352
The world exists for you only because you are,

52
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:31,444
otherwise it won't exist in your experience.

53
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:35,047
So, in every way this is important.

54
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:37,738
So, what is the purpose for this?

55
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:45,288
See, if you had a purpose and if you’ve fulfilled it,

56
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:49,582
after that what would you do?

57
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:52,276
After that, what would you do?

58
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:54,159
Bored, isn't it?

59
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:02,161
It is just that life is so intricate and so phenomenally intricate

60
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:07,087
that if you spend a 10,000 years looking at it carefully,

61
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:11,967
you still will not know it entirely.

62
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:16,951
If you spend a million years looking at it with absolute focus,

63
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:20,092
still you will not know it in its entirety.

64
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:22,320
That’s how it is.

65
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,142
There is...…Is there a meaning to it?

66
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:31,492
The greatest thing about life is that there is no meaning to it.

67
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:35,602
This is the greatest aspect of life that it has no meaning to it

68
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:39,282
and there is no need for it to have a meaning.

69
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:43,602
It is the pettiness of one’s mind that it’ll seek a meaning

70
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:51,522
because psychologically you will feel kind of unconnected with life

71
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,362
if you don’t have a purpose and a meaning.

72
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:59,272
People are constantly trying to create these false purposes.

73
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,496
Now, they were quite fine and happy.

74
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:05,759
Suddenly, they got married.

75
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,349
Now the purpose is the other person.

76
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:11,758
Then they have children.

77
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:14,164
Now they become miserable with each other.

78
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:18,112
Now the whole purpose that I go through all this misery is because the children.

79
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:20,212
Like this, it goes on.

80
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:23,257
These are things that you’re causing

81
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:26,974
and holding these as purposes of life

82
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:30,336
and is there a God-given purpose?

83
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:34,589
What if God does not know you exist?

84
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:37,601
No, I am just asking, by chance. (Laughter)

85
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:46,352
I am saying in this huge cosmos,

86
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,528
for which God is supposed to be the Creator

87
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:53,181
and the manager of these hundred billion galaxies,

88
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:55,341
in that this tiny little planet

89
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:56,284
and you

90
00:04:56,284 --> 00:05:00,454
Suppose he doesn’t know that you exist, what to do?

91
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:02,564
Possible or no?

92
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:05,530
I am sorry, I am saying such sacrilegious things

93
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,194
but is it possible or no?

94
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:10,768
What if he doesn’t know that you exist?

95
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:18,530
What if he doesn’t have a plan for you? (Laughter)

96
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,998
Suppose, he doesn’t have a plan for

97
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:24,308
an individual plan for you,

98
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:27,182
don’t look for such things.

99
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:31,818
The thing is the creation is made in such a way that

100
00:05:31,818 --> 00:05:34,847
Creation and Creator cannot be separated.

101
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,842
Here you are a piece of creation.

102
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:41,524
At the same time, the source of creation is throbbing within you.

103
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:45,275
If you pay little attention to this process of life,

104
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:46,973
you would not need any purpose.

105
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:50,377
It’ll keep you engaged for a million years if you want.

106
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:52,048
There is so much happening

107
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:57,225
so much means so much unbelievable things are happening right here.

108
00:05:57,225 --> 00:06:00,306
If you pay enough attention,

109
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:05,142
a million years of existence, it’ll keep you busy or more.

110
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:07,632
Right now, the need for purpose has come

111
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:11,134
because you’re trapped in your psychological structure,

112
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:13,649
not in your life process.

113
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:15,787
Psychologically your

114
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:20,951
your psychological structure functions from the limited data that it has gathered.

115
00:06:20,951 --> 00:06:25,151
Within that it rolls and right now,

116
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:30,782
your thought and emotion has become far more important than your life. Isn't it so?

117
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:32,325
Isn't it so?

118
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:37,146
So, because of this you’re seeking a purpose as an escape from the trap

119
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:41,086
that you have set for yourself.

120
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:43,643
It is a trap set by you.

121
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:46,678
You can easily come out of it.

122
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:48,970
If the trap was set for you by somebody else,

123
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,434
difficult to come out

124
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:54,734
because they’ll set the trap in such a way that you cannot come out, isn't it?

125
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:58,726
I am… I am talking about life not marriage,

126
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:00,527
that’s what I mean. (Laughter)

127
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:06,758
That’s what. (Laughs)

128
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:09,520
So this is a trap set by you.

129
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,786
This is easy to come out,

130
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:14,171
but that is the whole thing.

131
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:16,661
Why it is so difficult is

132
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:19,194
now you’re identified with the trap,

133
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:21,006
you like it.

134
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:27,734
You like it because it gives you a certain sense of

135
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:33,339
safety and security and protection and individual identity.

136
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:36,226
If you build a cocoon around yourself,

137
00:07:36,226 --> 00:07:37,778
it gives you safety,

138
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:40,611
but it also imprisons you.

139
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:46,502
Walls of self-preservation are also walls of self-imprisonment.

140
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:50,665
When it protects you, you like it.

141
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:55,418
When it restricts you, you do not like it.

142
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:57,911
That is why we have doors.

143
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:01,903
We like the walls because it's protecting us,

144
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:05,789
but we have doors so that we can open it and get out when we want to.

145
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:10,753
It doesn’t matter how nice it is, we still want to go out, isn't it?

146
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:14,700
So that is how it is with every trap that you set.

147
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,686
It doesn’t matter how nice it is, you still want to go out.

148
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:21,632
So, the psychological wall that you’ve built,

149
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:24,133
which gives you some sense of identity,

150
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:27,585
which gives you some sense of being a person

151
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:32,925
an individual person and which gives you security

152
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:34,873
beginning to experience it like a trap;

153
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:37,449
somewhere you want to break it.

154
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:43,469
So, one way of not breaking it is to find a purpose.

155
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,468
Those who find a purpose in their life,

156
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:48,055
they become so conceited.

157
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:50,904
They will live within their own trap forever

158
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:53,793
thinking that they’re doing the most fantastic thing.

159
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:56,736
First thing you need is balance.

160
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,880
If you have balance, then you can climb.

161
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,297
If you don’t have balance, it's better you stay on the ground”, isn't it?

162
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:10,360
It's not safe for somebody who is not balanced to climb high.

163
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,437
It's best you stay close to the ground.

164
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:14,632
You should not climb.

165
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:18,159
So, first thing is to establish a balance,

166
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,683
then you loosen your psychological structure,

167
00:09:21,683 --> 00:09:23,165
then it's a wonderful thing.

168
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:26,924
If you are loosening your psychological structure without balance,

169
00:09:26,924 --> 00:09:29,542
which lot of people are doing today

170
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:32,725
see, why does somebody want to drink alcohol or take a drug

171
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:38,601
because it loosens your psychological structure and makes you feel liberated for a moment

172
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:41,879
but without the necessary balance

173
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:47,322
you have not worked for the balance, but you got freedom.

174
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:53,091
Freedom without balance is destruction, anarchy, isn't it?

175
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:56,164
So, first thing is to work for balance,

176
00:09:56,164 --> 00:09:58,498
an enormous sense of balance

177
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,956
where even if you dismantle your psychological structure,

178
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:04,962
you can simply live here.

179
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:08,664
Dismantling your psychological structure is an important process

180
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:10,974
because that is your trap,

181
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:12,862
that is your security,

182
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,601
that is your stability

183
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:17,439
at the same time, that’s your trap

184
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:25,199
because the walls are set, you feel secured, but that’s also your trap.

185
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:28,962
If you dismantle your trap,

186
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,135
you also dismantle your security, isn't it?

187
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:34,632
You also dismantle your sense of purpose.

188
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:39,410
You also dismantle everything that matters to you.

189
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,468
So, that will need balance.

190
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:46,197
Without balance, if you dismantle you’ll go crazy.

191
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:48,819
But, don’t look for a purpose

192
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:53,274
because if you look for a purpose, you are seeking madness.

193
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:57,181
If you find one, you are sure mad.

194
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:00,933
Yes. (Laughter)

195
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:03,342
If you think you’ve found a purpose in life,

196
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:06,420
you still… you’re for sure gone crazy

197
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,593
because only the insane people have purpose

198
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:17,026
or people who have a purpose are insane in many ways.

199
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:19,342
These are things that you create in your mind

200
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:21,443
and believe it's true, isn't it?

201
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:25,917
Right now - ‘fighting for my country is my purpose’

202
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:33,932
right now if it's necessary, I’ll fight knowing fully well it's an unnecessary bloody fight.

203
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:34,975
Yes.

204
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:37,792
Then you’ll fight only to the extent it's necessary.

205
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,580
If you think this is your purpose,

206
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,900
you would want to destroy the whole world for what nonsense you believe in, isn't it?

207
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,190
If something is needed, we will do it

208
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,163
with… with absolute involvement.

209
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:51,788
There’s no other purpose.

210
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:55,525
The purpose of life is to live and to live totally.

211
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:59,290
To live totally does not mean party every night. (Laughter)

212
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,986
To live totally means

213
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:07,498
before you fall dead, every aspect of life has been explored

214
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:10,133
nothing has been left unexplored.

215
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,561
Yes?

216
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:16,157
Before you fall dead, even if you do not explore the cosmos,

217
00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:19,821
at least this piece of life (Referring to oneself) you must know it in its entirety.

218
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:22,902
That much you must do to yourself, isn't it?

219
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:27,076
That’s living totally that you experience the whole of this,

220
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:29,662
all dimensions of what this is. (Gestures)

221
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:33,338
You did not live anything untouched.

222
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:34,695
You just do that.

223
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:36,573
That will take a long time.

224
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:40,018
That’s …good enough purpose for you. (Laughs)
