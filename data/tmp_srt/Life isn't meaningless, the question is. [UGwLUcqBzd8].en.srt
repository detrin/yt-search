1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,280
um excuse me mate why are you what do you mean\h
what do you mean I mean what is the meaning of\h\h

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,720
your question the meaning of existence is the\h
meaning of my question no I'm asking you what the\h\h

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,280
meaning of your first question was the meaning of\h
you oh so you do know the meaning of Me no that's\h\h

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,640
what I'm asking you what is what is the meaning of\h
existence oh yeah that question doesn't make any\h\h

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,600
sense how come well what exactly are you asking\h
me are you asking me what my name means no I'm\h\h

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,800
asking you what you mean what existence is self\h
means I mean that I am the meaning of existence\h\h

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:42,360
is that it is yes but why is existence why are you\h
I could ask you the same uh well I exist because\h\h

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,760
my parents reproduced that doesn't explain why\h
your parents exist I could just keep asking why to\h\h

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,560
all of your responses all the way back to the Big\h
Bang at which point you'll essentially be saying\h\h

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,640
because existence began to which I will ask why\h
did existence begin and we will have arrived back\h\h

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:04,080
at square one so I'll ask again why why are you\h
um I exist to bring my future children into this\h\h

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,200
world ah but here we have the same issue again\h
just in the opposite direction I can keep asking\h\h

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,360
why until we get to the inevitable heat death of\h
the universe and you'll run out of answers that's\h\h

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,280
exactly the issue though that's why I'm asking\h
there's no meaning to any of it looking backwards\h\h

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,920
it's accidents all the way back and there's\h
no meaning to any of it looking forwards it\h\h

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,320
all comes to an end so that settles it then that's\h
your answer that it's all for nothing both ends of\h\h

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,600
the thread of time are loose and all you have to\h
do is pull and the whole damn thing unravels back\h\h

18
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,280
to the present moment and there's no real point\h
in getting out of bed in the morning no point in\h\h

19
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,160
having kids my parents gave birth to me for no\h
reason at all and it's all for nothing you're so\h\h

20
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,560
smart that you're Dum what you want to know what\h
it's all for but your linear mind won't accept a\h\h

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,040
circular answer and yet you ask a circular\h
question what's it all for it can't all be\h\h

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,960
for something else because then you wouldn't have\h
been talking about it all would you your question\h\h

23
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,000
cannot be answered without referring to something\h
within your expression at all for even if I did\h\h

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,360
give you an answer that referred to something\h
outside of it all like heaven for instance as soon\h\h

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,840
as its existence was an established fact it would\h
be contained within the expression it all and\h\h

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,520
since you're so set on rejecting circular answers\h
you would reject that answer too and ask okay but\h\h

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,200
what's heaven for the fact that you are yet to\h
discover the meaning of life is not evidence\h\h

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,080
that there isn't any just evidence that you're\h
terrible at asking the question you condemn me for\h\h

29
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,760
answering the question with existence means that\h
it is and yet when I ask you the same question you\h\h

30
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,480
go looking for answers in the past that no longer\h
exists then you go looking for answers in the\h\h

31
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,800
future which doesn't exist yet and then conclude\h
that it's all for nothing as if you had looked\h\h

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,960
everywhere you forgot to look in the present you\h
idiot the only place that actually exists and\h\h

33
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,920
since your question pertained to the nature of\h
of existence I'm almost inclined to believe you\h\h

34
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,840
don't even want existence to mean anything it's\h
as if you're intentionally avoiding the issue\h\h

35
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,280
by running off into the past or into the future\h
and acting surprised when you return empty-handed\h\h

36
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,920
carrying none of the meaning of existence that you\h
were supposedly looking for why on Earth would I\h\h

37
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,000
intentionally avoid finding answers because maybe\h
there's nothing you find scarier than the thought\h\h

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that all of existence is here simply for the\h
sake of itself and perhaps if nothing means\h\h

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,640
anything then everything is permitted and why\h
would I find that first bit scary because when\h\h

40
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,600
you don't like the state of things for example\h
the state of having lost a loved one or burning\h\h

41
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,520
your toast when you're already late to work the\h
idea that things are in that state simply for the\h\h

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:54,200
sake of existence puts you at odds with existence\h
itself the friend of an enemy is an enemy the soup\h\h

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,080
of Life arrives unblended and you've made a habit\h
of throwing the ball from the table when you get a\h\h

44
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,400
of something that you don't like H and what about\h
all that the meaning is in the present [\h__\h] you\h\h

45
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,400
were just saying how can that be true if the\h
present is always changing remember I told you\h\h

46
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,280
the meaning of existence is that it is and what's\h
the one thing that never changes about the present\h\h

47
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:24,400
moment the fact that it is that it exists and how\h
am I supposed to find meaning in that I ask you\h\h

48
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,920
what it's all for and whether you say it's all for\h
every reason it's all for no reason at all or it's\h\h

49
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,960
all for its own sake hardly makes a difference\h
to me I still feel lost what I want is for it\h\h

50
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,440
all to be for a single unifying reason I want a\h
grand narrative I want a triumphant ending I want\h\h

51
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,520
fireworks and explosions and eternal Redemption\h
not for all of existence to be an accident that\h\h

52
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,600
simply Fizzles out and dies a whimpering death yes\h
you want the suffering of today to be justified\h\h

53
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,000
by the joy of tomorrow but your science told you\h
that on a long enough time frame everything dies\h\h

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,640
and so you can't justify the suffering of today\h
like you say you want a triumphant ending and\h\h

55
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,720
eternal Redemption you want to be aware of some\h
Grand narrative today into which your suffering\h\h

56
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,200
reasonably fits so that you don't feel like\h
it's for nothing you want Solid Ground not an\h\h

57
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,560
ocean of doubt that's why you look to the past\h
and to the Future for meaning because you're in\h\h

58
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,760
search of a grand narrative on which to ground\h
yourself one that's always been active and will\h\h

59
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:30,120
continue to be active forever exactly and since\h
the beginning of Life was accidental and the end\h\h

60
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,360
of all life is certain there can't possibly be a\h
grand narrative to which my existence is relevant\h\h

61
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,400
I have no purpose Beyond myself but you're wrong\h
there is a grand narrative you just can't see the\h\h

62
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,120
big picture and I mean that quite literally also\h
you say that in millions of years nobody will\h\h

63
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,760
remember you and therefore everything you do today\h
will be irrelevant a million years from now but if\h\h

64
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,200
what you do today will be irrelevant a million\h
years from now then why should should a million\h\h

65
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,880
years from now be relevant to what you do today\h
all due respect sir you're a relatively primitive\h\h

66
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,800
talking monkey you see things linearly in terms\h
of beginnings and endings and you don't quite\h\h

67
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,960
understand the significance of happenings you say\h
that you're born there's stuff in the middle and\h\h

68
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:24,280
then you die but this is a child's perspective in\h
reality you just happen and you really do happen\h\h

69
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,800
I'm getting the sense that I won't ever understand\h
your answers can you present the truth in a way\h\h

70
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,080
that humans would understand so that we can stop\h
feeling that it's all for nothing and please focus\h\h

71
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:43,920
on this Grand narrative you speak of sure consider\h
this The Elements of Life happiness sadness pain\h\h

72
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:51,600
loss food sleep love burnt toast laughter they're\h
each like individual threads and they each have a\h\h

73
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,680
slightly different color and as you know some\h
are much darker than others in a single human\h\h

74
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,800
life all these billions of threads miraculously\h
converge they flirt and dance with each other they\h\h

75
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,640
intertwine and form the most beautiful patterns\h
that you call Stories the ultimate story of your\h\h

76
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,600
life is the string woven from these billions of\h
threads and at the end of your life that string\h\h

77
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,800
unravels itself and the threads part ways it\h
was life that brought them together and up to\h\h

78
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,920
the surface in your current state you can only\h
see your string in its entirety and you may have\h\h

79
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,760
put lots of effort effort into making sure that\h
it's a certain color in the final analysis so\h\h

80
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:40,920
the fact that it unravels causes you distress you\h
think linearly in terms of beginnings and endings\h\h

81
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,000
so you want your creation to last you want your\h
string to be endless but just as your threads\h\h

82
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,280
interweave horizontally to form the unique color\h
of the string of your life that uniquely colored\h\h

83
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,720
string then interweaves vertically with the\h
strings of others the people you meet and when\h\h

84
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,120
it does the color of both is forever changed you\h
are all Weavers and you create your string because\h\h

85
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,440
you want it to last but here's what you miss\h
it does last space and time are not separate\h\h

86
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,240
you figure this out yourselves a moment is not\h
endless but it is eternal you cannot measure the\h\h

87
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,480
length of a moment it's immeasurable because it's\h
Eternal you weave the string of your life because\h\h

88
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,920
you want it to be endless and sure both ends\h
of it are unraveled but the string itself has\h\h

89
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,280
interwoven with thousands of other strings so\h
while the string has Loose Ends its Center does\h\h

90
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:39,080
not come undone because of this zoom out and an\h
entire tapestry emerges painting a portrait with\h\h

91
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,840
patterns more beautiful and intricate than your\h
single human mind could ever imagine or perceive\h\h

92
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,920
before the threads of your string converged they\h
were hidden underneath the tapestry and after\h\h

93
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,200
they unravel they go back under but none of that\h
matters does it what matters is the tapestry and\h\h

94
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,440
this sense of insignificance of yours how dece\h
deceitful is that sense granted if you were to\h\h

95
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,480
decide to unravel your thread right now you would\h
forever darken the tapestry but that's the thing\h\h

96
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,000
you'll not have died you will have lived your\h
string will still remain within the magnum opus\h\h

97
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,800
of the universe itself you will not have removed\h
your string from the universe's self-portrait only\h\h

98
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,000
cut it short and short as it may be it will\h
remain but don't for a second think you could\h\h

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,840
remove your string entirely for without your\h
string the entire tapestry would come undone it\h\h

100
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:38,000
would sabotage that to which existence itself\h
is moving and you wonder why you don't get to\h\h

101
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,120
choose whether or not to be born you didn't\h
stumble into existence by chance you weren't\h\h

102
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,360
the recipient of an open invite you were drafted\h
because you are necessary to the entire Enterprise\h\h

103
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:59,400
of existence itself this tapestry is a portrait\h
of who Gods the universe existence whatever you\h\h

104
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,080
want to call it it's creating a self-portrait\h
one that a single mind could never comprehend\h\h

105
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,040
and even if it could it definitely wouldn't\h
remind a human of any self-portrait they've\h\h

106
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:17,320
seen before but since the tapestry is the Weaver\h
it's giving birth to itself but I'll never get\h\h

107
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,400
to see it so how is this relevant to me ah so the\h
Ultimate Painting to which your every experience\h\h

108
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,320
serves as a brush stroke isn't relevant to\h
you but the heat death of the universe is\h\h

109
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,440
I did not know your confusion reached such\h
depths to answer your question it's relevant\h\h

110
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,400
to you because it is you you are one of its many\h
limbs imagine your finger was to question its\h\h

111
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,960
relevance to your hand or your hand to question\h
its relevance to you in medical terms you call\h\h

112
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,400
that cancer and you say that you'll never see the\h
whole tapestry but how can you be so sure I mean\h\h

113
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,520
sorry what was your name again Adam well it may\h
be true that Adam might never see the tapestry but\h\h

114
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:06,320
how do you know that Adam is all that you are\h
the belief that you are Adam is only a partial\h\h

115
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:14,800
Truth at the same time you experience Adam so\h
you are the experiencer too and the experiencer\h\h

116
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,480
experiences every experience the whole tapestry\h
and while it may be hard for Adam to see that\h\h

117
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,680
after all Adam is but one string in a tapestry\h
of trillions it's nevertheless true it's all\h\h

118
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:36,200
Inseparable there is is not two you are everyone\h
but you only experience yourself one at a time\h\h

119
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,360
well I certainly don't consider myself to be\h
outside of the universe and that does seem\h\h

120
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,080
to align with what we know about physics but\h
still as Adam I want to see this tapestry that\h\h

121
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:52,280
supposedly justifies all the dark threads in my\h
string and yet I'm fated to never be able to if\h\h

122
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,400
the universe is really creating a self-portrait\h
why is it necessary to go about it in such a way\h\h

123
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:03,640
that leaves its participants in the dark well\h
firstly it's not true that you do not see the\h\h

124
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,960
tapestry true you just see one string at a time\h
for now at least but the amalgamation of all that\h\h

125
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:17,200
you've seen is the tapestry secondly faith is one\h
of the brightest threads in existence one of the\h\h

126
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,720
universe's proudest achievements and if it were\h
not for unfaith or the Absurd as philosophers call\h\h

127
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,160
it a thread which is opposite in color then\h
Faith would never stand out in the tapestry\h\h

128
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,320
I see but why is Faith so necessary to avoid\h
exactly the kind of predicament you found yourself\h\h

129
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,320
in you lack faith in the intrinsic value of both\h
your string and existence itself and so you go\h\h

130
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,680
looking for it you analyze your string looking\h
backwards you analyze it looking forwards and you\h\h

131
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,040
return empty-handed that is your punishment for\h
growing so arrogant as to assume that the meaning\h\h

132
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:00,480
of the tapestry could or should be comprehended\h
by a single string such as yourself you weave a\h\h

133
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,200
linear horizontal string all you can do is look\h
backwards and forwards and since you break current\h\h

134
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,480
eggs to make future omelets you assume the same\h
of the tapestry it all must exist to bring about\h\h

135
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,560
something other than itself it's why you couldn't\h
bear my answer I mean that I am no you don't want\h\h

136
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,040
the meaning of life you want the meaning of life\h
that you can understand sorry all good things come\h\h

137
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:32,960
at a cost it's one of the many stylistic choices\h
of the artist and meaning is priced in faith a\h\h

138
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:39,520
currency that went out of circulation amongst\h
your kind long ago but faith in what the Weaver\h\h

139
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,720
of the tapestry and the intrinsic goodness of the\h
whole Enterprise you mean I need to believe that\h\h

140
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,480
it's all being Guided by some intelligent entity\h
the Weaver as you call it I need to believe in\h\h

141
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,320
God basically you don't have to call it God I know\h
God's been having some PR issues amongst you a lot\h\h

142
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,280
recently you could call it the laws of physics if\h
that's more high fashion both phrases aim at the\h\h

143
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:07,280
same Target and both miss the mark so take your\h
pick but the laws of physics aren't intelligent\h\h

144
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:16,600
are you intelligent I'd like to think so yes are\h
you outside of the laws of physics no then the\h\h

145
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:24,080
laws of physics are intelligent well good point I\h
guess I am kind of the laws of physics in action\h\h

146
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,160
but what about the second element the faith in\h
the value of the tapestry the goodness of the\h\h

147
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,040
whole Enterprise when you look at a beautiful\h
sunset you value it but not because it helps\h\h

148
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:41,240
you achieve some goal in the future you value it\h
immediately for itself right yes well when you\h\h

149
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,160
doubt the intrinsic value of existence you look\h
for it not as you would a sunset or a beautiful\h\h

150
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,680
painting but as a tool what's it all for you ask\h
what higher purpose does it serve like a monkey\h\h

151
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,240
being handed to Mona Lisa and trying to use it\h
to crack open a nut life is not a stepping stone\h\h

152
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,600
you use to get somewhere else or an arcade ticket\h
you use to redeem for something better so long as\h\h

153
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,080
you see it that way you will forever torture\h
yourself needlessly with the question what is\h\h

154
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,200
the meaning of life it was never science that\h
destroyed your faith and meaning it was your\h\h

155
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,880
own intellectual Pride for if you hadn't seen your\h
scientific discoveries through such arrogant eyes\h\h

156
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,160
they would certainly have emboldened your faith\h
that the Weaver was indeed creating a tapestry\h\h

157
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,960
that was as you say worth it and as a result\h
you would consider it a privilege to be involved\h\h

158
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,720
you seem kind of annoyed at us well yeah you\h
are quite rude to me your lives are tricky I\h\h

159
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,040
get it you rarely know what you're up to and so\h
you obsessively sting yourself with the question\h\h

160
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:46,320
what am I doing which evolves into why am I\h
here and as your beloved nature said stings\h\h

161
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,880
of conscience teach one to sting eventually\h
you put me in your sights asked me why I am\h\h

162
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,240
and began to doubt my fundamental goodness and\h
as you know it's not nice to be the recipient\h\h

163
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,960
of such doubts I thought it was the tapestry's\h
fundamental goodness that we were guilty of\h\h

164
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:12,320
doubting yes I am the tapestry I see and we are a\h
part of you that has renounced your relevance to\h\h

165
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,440
us precisely just as cells in your body sometimes\h
renounce your relevance to them so what should we\h\h

166
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,320
do know that you are me just as the branch\h
is the tree and the wave is the ocean thus\h\h

167
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:32,440
understand that you experience all that has been\h
is being being or will ever be experienced and act\h\h

168
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:38,040
accordingly that's kind of ludicrous though I'm\h
not the universe I'm Adam then that is just how\h\h

169
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:58,840
you will remain for a time at least until Adam\h
unravels and then you'll have to face the music
