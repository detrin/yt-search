1
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,269
What are we doing here and where are we going
to go

2
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,270
It's like we just woke up one morning and
then it's welcome to the show

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:26,570
Don't ask any questions just go with the flow
Make as much money as you can and try your

4
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,630
best not to get broke
Copy everything you see on the tv

5
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,329
From the hairstyles to the clothes
And don't think too often just do exactly

6
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,600
as your told
You ever get confused then turn towards the

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,860
alcohol
You still hear your thoughts?

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,091
then just turn up the radio
As you learn to live a lifestyle of drugs,

9
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,580
sex and rock n roll

10
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:58,290
But in all honesty I just need to know
Is there more to the cycle than growing and

11
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,909
getting old
Living and dying just to leave behind a happy

12
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:04,890
home
And a whole lot of property that somebody

13
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,970
else is going to own
I just really need to know before the caskets

14
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,049
closed

15
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:16,710
Cause I'm not willing to gamble with my soul
nor am I ready to take any chances

16
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,770
These are just simple life questions and I'm
just searching for some answers

17
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,970
Like what are we doing here and what is our
purpose

18
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:32,740
How did we get here and who made us so perfect
And what happens once we go or is this world

19
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,650
all really worth it

20
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,430
Questions we don't answer because apparently
we don't really have to

21
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,200
There's no purpose to this life and our existence
merely natural?

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,700
In that case please let me ask you.

23
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,930
Did you create yourself or was it somebody
else that had fashioned you?

24
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,710
Because you're a being that's impeccable faultless
and unparalleled.

25
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,810
You are a product of supreme intelligence
and I'm merely being rational

26
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,600
For there isn't a camera on this earth that
can come close to the human eye

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,530
Nor a computer that can compete alongside
the human mind

28
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,060
And If the whole world was to come together
we wouldn't be able to create a single fly

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,030
So many signs yet we still deny

30
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,660
As science tries to justify that all this
could come from none

31
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,530
When It's a simple sum
Zero plus zero plus zero cannot possibly ever

32
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,310
give you one.

33
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,349
So from where did all this order come?

34
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:37,120
For everything has it's origins, a maker,
a creator of it's own

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,680
I mean the only reason your watching this
video is because somebody had to press upload

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,890
So you can believe in the Big Bang but I'd
rather Believe in He who caused it to explode.

37
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,800
Allah, The creator of the universe along with
every single soul

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,010
The Everliving, the Master the only one who
is in control

39
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,350
Unlike his creation, beyond our imagination
And NO -

40
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:09,650
He's not a man nor has he any partners in
association, He's on his own.

41
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:16,300
And neither did He ever leave us alone

42
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,310
Just like every manufacturer he left us with
an instruction manual

43
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:27,520
The Quran and Islam and I'm sorry to jump
to conclusions but it's the only one possible.

44
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,950
The only definition of God as the One and
Only, supreme being its logical,

45
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:40,700
A book with zero contradictions and miracles
that are both scientific and historical.

46
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,379
All revealed over 1400 years ago

47
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,840
Like the detailed description of the human
embryo

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,340
The expansion of the Universe and the creation
of everything from H20

49
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,319
To the mountains as pegs holding firm the
earth below

50
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,720
and the two seas that don't mix in a complete
separate flow

51
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:12,720
to the planets in orbit alternating night
and day as they stay in float

52
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,900
to the stories of the past and the preservation
of Pharaoh.

53
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,710
To identifying the lowest point in the land
where Persia defeated Rome

54
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:29,380
The gushing fluid that created man in the
glands between the ribs and the backbone.

55
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,389
And not a word has changed it's still the
same

56
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:40,199
So please explain how all this was known over
1400 years ago?

57
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,870
To a man who couldn't read or write, as he
would recite what the angel spoke.

58
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,229
And if you still don't believe please come
up with something that's even close.

59
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:52,889
But you can't.

60
00:04:52,889 --> 00:05:02,889
So we took God as a mockery and his Messengers
as a joke

61
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,990
Dismissed his scriptures as legends and tales
of the ancient folk.

62
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,370
As we live life according to our whims, desires
and hopes

63
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,310
Saying this life is the only home we will
ever know

64
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,540
We will live then die and simply turn to bones
YOLO.

65
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,990
Correction: After the grass dies the rain
arrives it re-grows

66
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,770
And Allah promises to do the same thing to
your very soul

67
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,240
And bring you back from your very fingertips
to your toes.

68
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,150
As the All Seeing Supreme Being watches us
so close as we are surely being tested.

69
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,050
In Our wealth, our health, our self and everything
that we've been blessed with

70
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,400
So believe for we will surely be resurrected.

71
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,600
And be brought to Lord in account for every
single deed

72
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,830
As he hands us our books and orders us to
"READ!"

73
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,910
From the bad to the good and everything in
between

74
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,050
You, yourself are sufficient for your own
accountability

75
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,449
So Don't be mad at me, Your Lord says...

76
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,300
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO THOUGHT HE WOULDN'T COME
BACK TO ME

77
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,509
I gave you a whole life long to search after
me

78
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:22,900
But you were busy chasing all that which was
temporary

79
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,870
So read, and glad tidings to all those who
believed,

80
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,759
but if you disbelieve
READ

81
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:39,460
And don't let that day be the first day you
find out what life really means.

82
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:39,569
READ
