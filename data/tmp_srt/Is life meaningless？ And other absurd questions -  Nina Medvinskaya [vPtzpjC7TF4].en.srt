1
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:11,601
Albert Camus grew up surrounded 
by violence.

2
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:16,219
His homeland of Algeria was mired 
in conflict between native Algerians

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,869
and colonizing French Europeans.

4
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,329
He lost his father in the First World War,

5
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:24,367
and was deemed unfit
to fight in the second.

6
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:28,526
Battling tuberculosis in France 
and confronting the war's devastation

7
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:32,906
as a resistance journalist,
Camus grew despondent.

8
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:38,773
He couldn’t fathom any meaning behind
all this endless bloodshed and suffering.

9
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:42,263
He asked: if the world was meaningless,

10
00:00:42,263 --> 00:00:46,790
could our individual lives 
still hold value?

11
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,930
Many of Camus’ contemporaries 
were exploring similar questions

12
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,860
under the banner of a new philosophy
called existentialism.

13
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,576
Existentialists believed people 
were born as blank slates,

14
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:04,457
each responsible for creating their life’s
meaning amidst a chaotic world.

15
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:07,517
But Camus rejected 
their school of thought.

16
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:11,397
He argued all people were born 
with a shared human nature

17
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:14,137
that bonded them toward common goals.

18
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:21,319
One such goal was to seek out meaning
despite the world’s arbitrary cruelty.

19
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:27,440
Camus viewed humanity’s desire for meaning
and the universe’s silent indifference

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,210
as two incompatible puzzle pieces,

21
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:37,069
and considered trying to fit them
together to be fundamentally absurd.

22
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:42,092
This tension became the heart 
of Camus’ Philosophy of the Absurd,

23
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:46,226
which argued that life
is inherently futile.

24
00:01:46,226 --> 00:01:49,046
Exploring how to live without meaning

25
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:52,686
became the guiding question
behind Camus’ early work,

26
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:56,696
which he called 
his “cycle of the absurd.”

27
00:01:56,696 --> 00:02:00,516
The star of this cycle, 
and Camus’ first published novel,

28
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:03,576
offers a rather bleak response.

29
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:08,611
"The Stranger" follows Meursault, 
an emotionally detached young man

30
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:12,351
who doesn’t attribute much 
meaning to anything.

31
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:15,611
He doesn’t cry at his mother’s funeral,

32
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:18,941
he supports his neighbor’s scheme
to humiliate a woman,

33
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:24,891
he even commits a violent crime —
but Meaursault feels no remorse.

34
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:31,298
For him the world is pointless 
and moral judgment has no place in it.

35
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:34,518
This attitude creates hostility 
between Meursault

36
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:37,468
and the orderly society he inhabits,

37
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:43,284
slowly increasing his alienation 
until the novel’s explosive climax.

38
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:49,108
Unlike his spurned protagonist, Camus 
was celebrated for his honest philosophy.

39
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:54,239
"The Stranger" catapulted him to fame,
and Camus continued producing works

40
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,239
that explored the value of life 
amidst absurdity

41
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,786
many of which circled back 
to the same philosophical question:

42
00:03:02,786 --> 00:03:05,216
if life is truly meaningless,

43
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:09,764
is committing suicide 
the only rational response?

44
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:13,444
Camus’ answer was an emphatic “no.”

45
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:17,534
There may not be any explanation 
for our unjust world,

46
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:21,507
but choosing to live regardless 
is the deepest expression

47
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:23,567
of our genuine freedom.

48
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:26,807
Camus explains this in one 
of his most famous essays

49
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:30,067
which centers on the Greek myth 
of Sisyphus.

50
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:33,267
Sisyphus was a king 
who cheated the gods,

51
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:38,054
and was condemned to endlessly 
roll a boulder up a hill.

52
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:42,827
The cruelty of his punishment 
lies in its singular futility,

53
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:47,476
but Camus argues all of humanity 
is in the same position.

54
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:50,926
And only when we accept 
the meaninglessness of our lives

55
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:55,130
can we face the absurd
with our heads held high.

56
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,575
As Camus says, when the king chooses
to begin his relentless task once more,

57
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:03,855
“One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”

58
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:07,855
Camus’ contemporaries
weren’t so accepting of futility.

59
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:11,405
Many existentialists advocated 
for violent revolution

60
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:17,038
to upend systems they believed were
depriving people of agency and purpose.

61
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:21,831
Camus responded with his second
set of work: the cycle of revolt.

62
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:26,111
In "The Rebel," he explored rebellion
as a creative act,

63
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:28,356
rather than a destructive one.

64
00:04:28,356 --> 00:04:31,286
Camus believed that inverting
power dynamics

65
00:04:31,286 --> 00:04:35,388
only led to an endless cycle of violence.

66
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:38,668
Instead, the way to avoid 
needless bloodshed

67
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:43,879
is to establish a public understanding 
of our shared human nature.

68
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,991
Ironically, it was this cycle 
of relatively peaceful ideas

69
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:52,615
that triggered his fallout with many
fellow writers and philosophers.

70
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:54,225
Despite the controversy,

71
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:58,993
Camus began work on his most lengthy
and personal novel yet:

72
00:04:58,993 --> 00:05:03,805
an autobiographical work
entitled "The First Man."

73
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:08,163
The novel was intended to be the first
piece in a hopeful new direction:

74
00:05:08,163 --> 00:05:10,273
the cycle of love.

75
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:14,544
But in 1960, Camus suddenly died 
in a car accident

76
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:19,206
that can only be described 
as meaningless and absurd.

77
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:22,046
While the world never saw
his cycle of love,

78
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:27,798
his cycles of revolt and absurdity
continue to resonate with readers today.

79
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:32,346
His concept of absurdity has become
a part of world literature,

80
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:37,283
20th century philosophy,
and even pop culture.

81
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:42,645
Today, Camus remains a trusted guide
for moments of uncertainty;

82
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:48,745
his ideas defiantly imbuing 
a senseless world with inspiration

83
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:50,325
rather than defeat.
