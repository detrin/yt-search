1
00:00:06,688 --> 00:00:10,568
At the age of 21, Simone de Beauvoir 
became the youngest person

2
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:15,038
to take the philosophy exams
at France’s most esteemed university.

3
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:17,048
She passed with flying colors.

4
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:19,580
But as soon as she mastered 
the rules of philosophy,

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,350
she wanted to break them.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,380
She’d been schooled 
on Plato’s Theory of Forms,

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,280
which dismissed the physical world 
as a flawed reflection

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,220
of higher truths and unchanging ideals.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,070
But for de Beauvoir, 
earthly life was enthralling, sensual,

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,020
and anything but static.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,360
Her desire to explore the physical world 
to its fullest would shape her life,

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,656
and eventually, 
inspire a radical new philosophy.

13
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:49,045
Endlessly debating with her romantic 
and intellectual partner Jean Paul Sartre,

14
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:53,275
de Beauvoir explored free will, desire, 
rights and responsibilities,

15
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:56,105
and the value of personal experience.

16
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:58,215
In the years following WWII,

17
00:00:58,215 --> 00:01:00,825
these ideas would converge 
into the school of thought

18
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:05,465
most closely associated with their work: 
existentialism.

19
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,626
Where Judeo-Christian traditions 
taught that

20
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:10,185
humans are born with preordained purpose,

21
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:14,105
de Beauvoir and Sartre proposed 
a revolutionary alternative.

22
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:16,315
They argued that humans are born free,

23
00:01:16,315 --> 00:01:19,545
and thrown into existence 
without a divine plan.

24
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:24,335
As de Beauvoir acknowledged, this freedom 
is both a blessing and a burden.

25
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:28,992
In "The Ethics of Ambiguity" she argued 
that our greatest ethical imperative

26
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:31,412
is to create our own life’s meaning,

27
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:34,446
while protecting the freedom 
of others to do the same.

28
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:36,136
As de Beauvoir wrote,

29
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:41,524
“A freedom which is interested only 
in denying freedom must be denied.”

30
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:45,754
This philosophy challenged its students 
to navigate the ambiguities and conflicts

31
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:49,554
our desires produce, 
both internally and externally.

32
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:52,486
And as de Beauvoir sought to find 
her own purpose,

33
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:54,016
she began to question:

34
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:56,996
if everyone deserves 
to freely pursue meaning,

35
00:01:56,996 --> 00:02:01,586
why was she restricted by society’s ideals
of womanhood?

36
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:04,837
Despite her prolific writing, 
teaching and activism,

37
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:08,406
de Beauvoir struggled 
to be taken seriously by her male peers.

38
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:11,846
She’d rejected her Catholic upbringing 
and marital expectations

39
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:16,160
to study at university, and write memoirs,
fiction and philosophy.

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,880
But the risks she was taking 
by embracing this lifestyle

41
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,300
were lost on many 
of her male counterparts,

42
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,500
who took these freedoms for granted.

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,570
They had no intellectual interest 
in de Beauvoir’s work,

44
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,780
which explored women’s inner lives,

45
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,800
as well the author’s open relationship 
and bisexuality.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,070
To convey the importance 
of her perspective,

47
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,600
de Beauvoir embarked 
on her most challenging book yet.

48
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,910
Just as she’d created the foundations 
of existentialism,

49
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,370
she’d now redefine the limits of gender.

50
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,674
Published in 1949, "The Second Sex" 
argues that, like our life’s meaning,

51
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:52,694
gender is not predestined.

52
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,786
As de Beauvoir famously wrote,

53
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:58,406
“one is not born, but rather becomes, 
woman.”

54
00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:02,666
And to “become” a woman, she argued, 
was to become the Other.

55
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:06,389
De Beauvoir defined Othering 
as the process of labeling women

56
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,526
as less than the men who’d 
historically defined, and been defined as,

57
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:13,011
the ideal human subjects.

58
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:17,176
As the Other, she argued that women 
were considered second to men,

59
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:21,546
and therefore systematically restricted 
from pursuing freedom.

60
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:24,944
"The Second Sex" became 
an essential feminist treatise,

61
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:27,556
offering a detailed history 
of women’s oppression

62
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:29,998
and a wealth of anecdotal testimony.

63
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:33,068
"The Second Sex"’s combination 
of personal experience

64
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:34,888
and philosophical intervention

65
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:38,368
provided a new language 
to discuss feminist theory.

66
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,920
Today, those conversations are still 
informed by de Beauvoir’s insistence

67
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,780
that in the pursuit of equality,

68
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,708
“there is no divorce between 
philosophy and life.”

69
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,518
Of course, like any foundational work,

70
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:55,498
the ideas in "The Second Sex" have been 
expanded upon since its publication.

71
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:58,888
Many modern thinkers have explored 
additional ways people are Othered

72
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:00,978
that de Beauvoir doesn’t acknowledge.

73
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:03,768
These include racial 
and economic identities,

74
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:09,058
as well as the broader spectrum of gender 
and sexual identities we understand today.

75
00:04:09,058 --> 00:04:11,328
De Beauvoir’s legacy 
is further complicated

76
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:16,002
by accusations of sexual misconduct 
by two of her university students.

77
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:17,872
In the face of these accusations,

78
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:21,972
she had her teaching license revoked 
for abusing her position.

79
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:26,292
In this aspect and others, 
de Beauvoir’s life remains controversial—

80
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:31,342
and her work represents a contentious 
moment in the emergence of early feminism.

81
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:34,862
She participated in those conversations 
for the rest of her life;

82
00:04:34,862 --> 00:04:39,788
writing fiction, philosophy, 
and memoirs until her death in 1986.

83
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:42,618
Today, her work offers 
a philosophical language

84
00:04:42,618 --> 00:04:46,182
to be reimagined, revisited 
and rebelled against—

85
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:49,833
a response this revolutionary thinker 
might have welcomed.
