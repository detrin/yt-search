isn't to get to the highest level before
 

361
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,950
isn't to get to the highest level before
you die it's not it's to identify

00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:29,960
you die it's not it's to identify
 

363
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,709
you die it's not it's to identify
which category you're in right now and

that your friendships are a bit lacking
and you spent the next one year getting

376
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,000
and you spent the next one year getting
 

377
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,470
and you spent the next one year getting
as many friends and hang out with as

378
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:53,480
as many friends and hang out with as
 

379

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,949
many existing friends as you can and
finally filling that Gap in your heart

382
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
finally filling that Gap in your heart
 

383
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,949
finally filling that Gap in your heart
and reaching self the self-esteem tier

384
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:01,959
and reaching self the self-esteem tier
 

385
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,110
and reaching self the self-esteem tier
versus someone else who's in the same

386
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,120
versus someone else who's in the same
 

387
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,670
versus someone else who's in the same
situation but spends 5 years just

388
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:08,680
situation but spends 5 years just
 

389
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,230
situation but spends 5 years just
focusing on his friendships and never

391
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,670
focusing on his friendships and never
really reaching the next rung of the

392
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
really reaching the next rung of the
 

393
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,790
really reaching the next rung of the
pyramid you can't say that you are

394
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
pyramid you can't say that you are
 

395
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,870
pyramid you can't say that you are
happier than the other person it doesn't

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,470
happier than the other person it doesn't
mean when you're higher up you you're

398
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:21,480
mean when you're higher up you you're
 

399
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,949
mean when you're higher up you you're
more fulfilled this is just a way of

400
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:23,959
more fulfilled this is just a way of
 

401
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,190
more fulfilled this is just a way of
identifying what your meaning of life is

402

impact you make in the world people are
 

427
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,509
impact you make in the world people are
going to forget you all those like ideas

428
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
going to forget you all those like ideas
 

429
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,870
going to forget you all those like ideas
from philosophers yeah it gets you to

430
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:57,880
from philosophers yeah it gets you to
 

431
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,710
from philosophers yeah it gets you to
think and I understand all of them but

432
00:09:59,710 --> 00:09:59,720
think and I understand all of them but
 

433
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,190
think and I understand all of them but
it doesn't really give you a concrete

434
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:02,200
it doesn't really give you a concrete
 

435
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,990
it doesn't really give you a concrete
idea on what you should do like what

436
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
idea on what you should do like what
 

437
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,829
idea on what you should do like what
your meaning is in life let's say

438
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
your meaning is in life let's say
 

439
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,590
your meaning is in life let's say
Aristotle right the meaning of life is

440
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
Aristotle right the meaning of life is
 

441
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,710
Aristotle right the meaning of life is
to seek pleasure and to avoid pain let's

442
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:09,720
to seek pleasure and to avoid pain let's
 

443
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,870
to seek pleasure and to avoid pain let's
say you're in love and belonging right

444
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:11,880
say you're in love and belonging right
 

445
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,310
say you're in love and belonging right
when you work on your friendships

446
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,320
when you work on your friendships
 

447
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,110
when you work on your friendships
because you're lacking in that you are

448
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
because you're lacking in that you are
 

449
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,829
because you're lacking in that you are
gaining pleasure and you are avoiding

450
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839
gaining pleasure and you are avoiding
 

451
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,910
gaining pleasure and you are avoiding
pain right so it's it's sort of like on

452
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:18,920
pain right so it's it's sort of like on
 

453
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,310
pain right so it's it's sort of like on
another Continuum if that makes sense it

454
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:21,320
another Continuum if that makes sense it
 

455
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,630
another Continuum if that makes sense it
doesn't really tell you concrete steps

456
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:23,640
doesn't really tell you concrete steps
 

457
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,030
doesn't really tell you concrete steps
you need to take so I took meaning of

458
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,040
you need to take so I took meaning of
 

459
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,269
you need to take so I took meaning of
life the actual philosophy course and

460
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:28,279
life the actual philosophy course and
 

461
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,030
life the actual philosophy course and
you see I got an A in that course I

462
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,040
you see I got an A in that course I
 

463
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,110
you see I got an A in that course I
didn't study I got an A so those

464
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,120
didn't study I got an A so those
 

465
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,069
didn't study I got an A so those
philosophers it's irrelevant I'm better

466
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
philosophers it's irrelevant I'm better
 

467
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,389
philosophers it's irrelevant I'm better
than them I hope you figured out the

468
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
than them I hope you figured out the
 

469
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,069
than them I hope you figured out the
meaning in your life and what did I tell

470
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:39,079
meaning in your life and what did I tell
 

471
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,949
meaning in your life and what did I tell
you all these other sources that you saw

472
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:41,959
you all these other sources that you saw
 

473
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,910
you all these other sources that you saw
it doesn't really give you a clear idea

474
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
it doesn't really give you a clear idea
 

475
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,710
it doesn't really give you a clear idea
on what the meaning of life is but this

476
