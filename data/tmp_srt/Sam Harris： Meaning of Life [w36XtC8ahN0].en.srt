00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
there's just a mirage-like quality to
 

333
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,469
there's just a mirage-like quality to
every future attainment

334

that eventually you get the lesson that

340
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
that eventually you get the lesson that
 

341
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,230
that eventually you get the lesson that
you never quite arrive right like you

342
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
you never quite arrive right like you
 

343
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,150
you never quite arrive right like you
you won't you don't you don't

344
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
you won't you don't you don't
 

345
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,390
you won't you don't you don't
arrive until you cease to step over the

346
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
arrive until you cease to step over the
 

347
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,230
arrive until you cease to step over the
present moment in search of

348
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
present moment in search of
 

349
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,510
present moment in search of
the next thing i mean we're constantly

350
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
the next thing i mean we're constantly
 

351
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,629
the next thing i mean we're constantly
we're we're stepping over the thing that

352
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
we're we're stepping over the thing that
 

353
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,990
we're we're stepping over the thing that
we think we're

354
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
we think we're
 

355
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,189
we think we're
seeking in the act of seeking it and so

356
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
seeking in the act of seeking it and so
 

357
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,790
seeking in the act of seeking it and so
it is kind of a paradox

358
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
it is kind of a paradox
 

359
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,670
it is kind of a paradox
i mean there is a there's this paradox

360
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
i mean there is a there's this paradox
 

361
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,150
i mean there is a there's this paradox
that

362
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
that
 

363
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,990
that
which i mean it sounds trite but it's

364
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
which i mean it sounds trite but it's
 

365
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,110
which i mean it sounds trite but it's
like you you can't

366
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
like you you can't
 

367
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,189
like you you can't

be happy and and and it's that it's the
 

371
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,110
be happy and and and it's that it's the
illusion that because

372
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
illusion that because
 

373
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,909
