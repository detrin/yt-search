1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,440
According to French-Algerian philosopher Albert
Camus, our world has no ultimate meaning,

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,200
but if it had, it would be impossible to know
it.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,360
It’s all pretty pointless as if the universe
is nothing more than a cosmic coincidence,

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,550
born without any specific goal or significance.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,670
For some, such a meaningless existence could
lead to despair and even worse.

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,470
So it seems that, for many, meaning is necessary
to live; and without meaning, life is not

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,540
worth living.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,910
Humans crave purpose; no wonder that they
massively subscribe to belief systems that

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,510
provide it, even if what they provide isn’t
rationally explicable.

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,130
Taking such a “leap of faith,” Albert
Camus considered philosophical suicide, as

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,960
we break with reason and embrace a conviction
just to answer the human desire for existential

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,900
purpose when there isn’t any.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,920
This discrepancy between the human impulse
to ask ultimate questions and the impossibility

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,540
of finding adequate answers, Camus called
The Absurd.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,689
In a previous video about Albert Camus, we
explored his philosophy of Absurdism and ways

16
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:10,350
to deal with a meaningless existence.

17
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,930
This video focuses more on how to live in
the face of life’s absurdity or, more specifically,

18
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,741
how to be an absurd man (or woman, for that
matter).

19
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,689
Is a meaningless life worth living?

20
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:34,100
According to Albert Camus, it is.

21
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,709
He believed we never live life fully if we
keep looking for its meaning.

22
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:41,729
His book The Myth of Sisyphus states:

23
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,359
People have played on words and pretended
to believe that refusing to grant a meaning

24
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:51,539
to life necessarily leads to declaring that
it is not worth living.

25
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:56,859
In truth, there is no necessary common measure
between these two judgments.

26
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,619
End quote.

27
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,799
This human requirement for meaning opposing
an impersonal, cold, silent universe that

28
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,349
doesn’t provide us any hint of inherent
meaning or purpose, aka The Absurd, often

29
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:12,160
drives people into escapism.

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,569
Some find their meaning in a religion that
offers them not only the purpose of life but

31
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:22,290
also the origins of the universe, divine rules
of conduct, and the possibility of reward

32
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,650
in the afterlife.

33
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,530
Others refuse to take the leap of faith (or
their rational minds simply don’t allow

34
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,790
them to) but experience the subsequent void
of pointlessness so unbearably that they decide

35
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,000
to make away with themselves (thus, suicide).

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,510
The latter, Camus considered the only serious
philosophical problem.

37
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,440
Camus distinguished two forms of suicide:
on the one end, physical suicide, and on the

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,909
other, ‘philosophical suicide.’

39
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:56,319
By escaping from the absurd, we either end
up dead or as ‘walking dead;’ the latter

40
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,239
are individuals who exchanged the painful,
absurd truth for comforting substitutes.

41
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,180
They are the blue-pilled masses - the sheep
- fooling themselves and each other, existing

42
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,379
under the veil of blissful ignorance.

43
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,510
According to Camus, we should not give in
to the absurd.

44
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,749
Instead, we should accept the inherent meaninglessness
of the universe and revolt against it.

45
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:21,370
He stated:

46
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,650
By the mere activity of consciousness I transform
into a rule of life what was an invitation

47
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,060
to death—and I refuse suicide.

48
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,909
End quote.

49
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:37,180
Camus believed that a meaningless life is
worth living if we remain aware of the absurd

50
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,260
contradiction between the human craving for
ultimate meaning and the universe’s negligence

51
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,769
in providing one.

52
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,662
To flourish in the face of this absurdity,
we have to become absurd ourselves.

53
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:58,299
To the absurd man, Camus ascribed three characteristics:
revolt, freedom, and passion.

54
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,629
First, the absurd man refuses to accept the
“invitation to death,” as he doesn’t

55
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:06,400
commit physical or philosophical suicide.

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,459
He entirely accepts the conflict between the
human desire for meaning and the impossibility

57
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,400
of finding ultimate purpose and doesn’t
need any false, comforting substitutes to

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,160
solve this conflict.

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,699
He acknowledges that he cannot solve the conflict
and doesn’t wish to do so.

60
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:28,389
And so, he revolts against his own instinctive
hunger for meaning, but also against the world,

61
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:33,630
throwing all kinds of solutions at his face,
sometimes even forcing him to commit to a

62
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,680
belief system.

63
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,830
An example of the absurd man in revolt is
the character Meursault from Camus’ book

64
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,830
The Stranger.

65
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,610
Meursault is a solitary individual who enjoys
simple pleasures like swimming in the sea

66
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,690
and being in the company of a woman named
Marie.

67
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,300
When his mother dies, he doesn’t show grief.

68
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,020
And when an Arab man on the beach threatens
him with a knife, he shoots him and doesn’t

69
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,680
show sorrow afterward.

70
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,400
Meursault doesn’t act in ways he in which
doesn’t feel inclined to act just to fit

71
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,759
in with the rest or because it’s moral to
do so.

72
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,820
The people in his environment are disgusted
by Meursault’s lack of emotions, a personality

73
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,980
trait weighed heavily when the judge sentences
him to death.

74
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,150
While waiting for his execution, the prison’s
chaplain tries to convert him to Christianity,

75
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:27,759
but Meursault refuses, as he embraces the
world as it is: meaningless, random, indifferent.

76
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,150
In doing so, he revolts against the human
thirst for an ultimate purpose.

77
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,370
Although Meursault’s life was ending, he
died a free man, as in he didn’t sell out

78
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,970
to any artificial meanings or irrational belief
systems.

79
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,690
Camus wrote about the absurd man:

80
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,169
He who, without negating it, does nothing
for the eternal.

81
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:51,370
Not that nostalgia is foreign to him.

82
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,220
But he prefers his courage and his reasoning.

83
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,620
The first teaches him to live without appeal
and to get along with what he has; the second

84
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,580
informs him of his limits.

85
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,940
Assured of his temporally limited freedom,
of his revolt devoid of future, and of his

86
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,180
mortal consciousness, he lives out his adventure
within the span of his lifetime.

87
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,509
End quote
There are many interpretations of what Camus

88
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,020
meant by “living without appeal.”

89
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,960
But from reading the myth of Sisyphus and
his novels, he seems to point to an existence

90
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,409
in which one doesn’t engage in the absurd
search for ultimate meaning.

91
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:33,160
Living without appeal means embracing the
here and now, acknowledging that there isn’t

92
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:40,160
anything to see for him beyond the mundane;
no higher purpose or divine morals, no afterlife,

93
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
nothing.

94
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,450
It seems to be a life without the intention
to appeal to anything more than the indifference,

95
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,740
limitations, and meaninglessness we find in
the ordinary.

96
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,580
Such an existence may come across as nihilistic.

97
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,889
With Meursault’s character, Camus presents
a nihilistic tragic hero who doesn’t care

98
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:03,639
about morality and just lives nihilistically,
gratifying his senses.

99
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,499
He sees no inherent meaning in the universe
and manages to live happily without it.

100
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,610
Aside from the characters in his novels, Camus
provided several examples of people he considered

101
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,990
to have embraced the absurd in his book The
Myth of Sisyphus.

102
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,130
These examples illustrate how one could live
in the face of meaninglessness (as Camus called

103
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,870
it) without appeal.

104
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,800
Although they might look like them, Camus
probably didn’t intend to present these

105
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,419
examples as ‘archetypes,’ as they’re
not models that one should strive to live

106
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:41,410
by; they’re just examples of absurd individuals.

107
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,060
If one aims to live the ‘absurd life,’
it’s probably better to focus on why these

108
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,889
people are absurd instead of mirroring their
actions.

109
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,069
The Seducer

110
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,080
As his first example of the absurd man, Camus
presents a well-known womanizer named Don

111
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,639
Juan.

112
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,759
This fictional character goes from woman to
woman, using the same tactics for each woman

113
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,379
he conquers, devoting his whole life to seduction.

114
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:12,729
Many people would consider the existence of
an individual that revolves entirely around

115
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:16,440
the conquest of short-term lovers as shallow.

116
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,229
How empty is someone’s life who does the
same thing repeatedly, and how significant

117
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:26,259
is the risk of ending up alone and miserable
with such a lifestyle?

118
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:31,170
Others believe that beyond the veil of Don
Juan’s actions hides a man’s desperate

119
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,870
search for true love.

120
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,090
But these claims assume that Don Juan needs
(or looks for) something beyond what he’s

121
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,090
already doing.

122
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:45,380
His life’s repetition, devoid of a higher
purpose, must be an effort to ultimately attain

123
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,880
that higher purpose or, perhaps, a means of
escaping from it.

124
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,740
From the perspective that a fulfilled life
requires meaning beyond the engagement in

125
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,850
something banal like repetitive seduction
using the same tricks and tactics, a figure

126
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,780
like Don Juan is tragic.

127
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:07,690
But, Camus argues, to Don Juan, the pleasure
of seducing women and making love to them

128
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,850
is enough.

129
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,570
He lives for the moment and the joy of it.

130
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,020
Moreover, the quantity of his partners doesn’t
mean that he doesn’t love.

131
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,980
He does love and gives his love to many.

132
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:24,060
Does that make it less valuable than what
people consider ‘true love?’

133
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,390
The Actor

134
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:31,320
The second example of the absurd individual
comes in the form of a stage actor, who made

135
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,570
a career out of experiencing many lives intensely.

136
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,200
The stage actor embraces at least two realities
of life: that our lives are fleeting and that

137
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,470
there’s no point in aiming for long-lasting
fame.

138
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,670
As opposed to actors in films or writers whose
works survive for millennia, the performances

139
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,340
of stage actors will not be recorded for generations
to enjoy.

140
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,910
Their actions on stage only count in the present
moment, and there will be no trace of them

141
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,270
except within themselves and the people who
observe them.

142
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,820
And the stage actor doesn’t mind that his
actions aren’t eternalized.

143
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,400
After all, looking at the vastness of the
universe and the limitlessness of time, even

144
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,000
the works of the ancient philosophers won’t
survive.

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,650
And thus, the ambition to leave a legacy is
pretty pointless.

146
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:24,020
Therefore, stage acting embodies the absurd
life, which takes place in the present, for

147
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,900
the moment, without appeal for anything beyond
that.

148
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,620
When we look at plays, movies, and television
series, we always see the critical moments

149
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,230
of the characters’ lives: the most passionate,
emotional, and dramatic events.

150
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,190
And so, the actor lives the highlights of
all these different lives passionately within

151
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:47,590
one lifespan, as opposed to the dull existence
of one life, let alone a life spent chasing

152
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:53,380
eternal happiness in the future, which, often,
consists of following life-denying rules to

153
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,920
purchase it.

154
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,320
The actor lives the lives of people who aren’t
absurd like himself, but he lives them fleetingly.

155
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,300
Paradoxically, by living many different lives,
the actor manages not to be tangled up in

156
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,300
life.

157
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,970
By keeping his distance, he doesn’t fall
into the trap of taking these lives too seriously.

158
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,100
He realizes that we all play roles, and everything
we do is futile.

159
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,720
The difference between the absurd man and
the rest is that the former knows it.

160
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,320
Those who don’t know – the majority of
people – have conditioned themselves to

161
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:33,410
pretend that their pretense is no pretense
but serious business; it amounts to something.

162
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:39,760
But it doesn’t unless we follow some belief
telling us it does, according to the Absurdist

163
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
philosophy.

164
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,580
The absurd individual (in the form of an actor)
is aware of the absurd but embraces the characters’

165
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,580
lives.

166
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,000
He’s pretending, enjoying the process, the
momentary appreciation of the audience, and

167
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,950
thus affirming life by living many lives.

168
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,830
Still, he sees the drama, the rules we cast
upon ourselves, and the meaning we ascribe

169
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,110
to our existence as a big joke.

170
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,830
The Conqueror

171
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,660
The conqueror that Camus describes lives an
absurd life because she’s fully aware of

172
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,660
the futility of her actions but engages in
them nonetheless.

173
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,020
She doesn’t spend time contemplating and
doesn’t concern herself with the afterlife

174
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,800
or higher ideals.

175
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,790
She lives for the world her senses perceive,
namely, the here and now.

176
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,140
Absurd conquerors know that their actions
are ultimately pointless.

177
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,640
They’ll never conquer fate, and any change
they make in the world will eventually be

178
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
undone.

179
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,200
The empires of old, forged with the blood
of many, have all ceased to exist.

180
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,530
Fighters for social justice might progress
in their time, but their accomplishments will

181
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,380
perish in the long run.

182
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,470
Fate wins every time.

183
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:54,810
And the ultimate fate of all is destruction,
the great silence after a brief, insignificant

184
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:59,080
moment of liveliness somewhere in a dark corner
of the universe.

185
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,980
Hence, the conqueror acts as if.

186
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,920
Her goal isn’t victory (although it would
be nice).

187
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,830
Her goal is to conquer herself, experiencing
the triumph over her body and mind again and

188
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,830
again.

189
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,050
The conquerer wants to feel strong through
victory after victory and thus seeks to live

190
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,840
life at a high level.

191
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,521
The friendships on the battlefield, the close
relationships formed during conflict, she

192
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:26,290
holds dear, as they’re intense and passionate.

193
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:32,390
According to Camus, the absurd conqueror chooses
the sword over the cross, as the former concerns

194
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,500
what’s certain, and the latter is just a
matter of hope and belief.

195
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,660
I quote:

196
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,200
There always comes a time when one must choose
between contemplation and action.

197
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,240
This is called becoming a man.

198
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,770
Such wrenches are dreadful.

199
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,040
But for a proud heart there can be no compromise.

200
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,930
There is God or time, that cross or this sword.

201
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:00,330
This world has a higher meaning that transcends
its worries, or nothing is true but those

202
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,330
worries.

203
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:07,220
One must live with time and die with it, or
else elude it for a greater life.

204
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,050
End quote.

205
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,570
The seducer, the actor, and the conqueror
all play the absurd.

206
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,000
They live in the present, lucidly, without
hope.

207
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,900
Being without hope isn’t the same as being
hopeless, says Camus.

208
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,691
Hopelessness is a form of despair that results
from being unable to embrace the absurd: being

209
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:29,440
without the thing one desperately craves.

210
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,447
However, being without hope can be a pleasurable
experience, according to Camus, if we acknowledge

211
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:39,498
that it’s all pointless but live life intensely
nonetheless.

212
00:14:42,374 --> 00:14:43,381
Thank you for watching.
