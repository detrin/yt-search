1
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:07,879
Life is amazing. Life is incredible.

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:13,009
The experiences we have,
the possibilities of personal achievement.

3
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:14,761
You could summit Everest.

4
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:17,639
You could create
a huge, successful business.

5
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:19,057
You could give a TED Talk.

6
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:24,020
And when you're successful,
it feels incredible.

7
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:28,108
Success, the flush of excitement,
the celebration.

8
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:29,818
And you should celebrate.

9
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:32,529
The congratulations,
the posting on Instagram

10
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:34,322
or wherever you put your stuff up.

11
00:00:34,322 --> 00:00:35,865
It all feels great.

12
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:39,828
But when that fades,
when that starts to fade,

13
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:42,706
sometimes slowly, sometimes all at once,

14
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:47,627
a question comes up:
"Is this it? Is this all there is?"

15
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:52,048
And so I'm going to tell you a little
story about myself,

16
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:53,717
to give you a sense of this.

17
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:57,304
For those of you who don't know,
I'm a professor at Stanford.

18
00:00:57,345 --> 00:01:02,309
When I got my job, I was elated, elated,

19
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,103
and a little bit terrified.

20
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:10,358
And I was terrified
because when you get a job like that,

21
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:13,486
you know you’re going to be reviewed
in about seven years.

22
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:17,616
And either you’re going to get tenure,
more or less a job for life,

23
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:19,576
or you're going to get fired.

24
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:21,119
(Laughs)

25
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:24,456
It's a little bit like that movie
"Glengarry Glen Ross,"

26
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:28,668
the scene where Alec Baldwin's character
goes in to give the motivational speech,

27
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:30,795
and he says, "It's going
to be a competition.

28
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:34,174
First prize, Cadillac Eldorado.

29
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:37,344
Second prize, set of steak knives.

30
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:39,554
Third prize, you're fired."

31
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:43,099
It's a little bit like that,
except there's no second prize.

32
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,434
(Laughter)

33
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:49,522
And it turns out, as you might imagine,
that has a way of focusing your mind.

34
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:53,234
Right? So I was really, really
focused on doing good research,

35
00:01:53,276 --> 00:01:56,529
getting my papers published,
doing well in the classroom

36
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:59,574
and all the other little things
you need to do to get tenure.

37
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:03,453
And seven years later, I made it.

38
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:04,537
(Applause)

39
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:05,705
Thank you.

40
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:06,790
(Applause)

41
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:10,794
And it was a huge relief,
and I was so excited.

42
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:12,671
I was so excited.

43
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:17,133
But that question came up, is this it?

44
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:20,387
Is this is this really all? All there is?

45
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:23,264
And I reflected back,

46
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:26,267
and I thought about the time
I spent in undergrad ...

47
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:29,896
five years in grad school, the tears.

48
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:31,356
And there were a lot of tears.

49
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:33,608
The seven years of trying to get tenure.

50
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,819
And I had expected, I had hoped

51
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,154
that when I made it past that,
when I succeeded,

52
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:41,157
when I went through that threshold,
life would feel different.

53
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,575
I would feel fulfilled.

54
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:44,160
It would feel meaningful to me.

55
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,204
My life would feel meaningful.

56
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:50,375
But it turns out
that wasn't what happened.

57
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:54,087
Now when psychologists
talk about meaningfulness in life,

58
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:58,425
what they're talking about
is a sense that our lives matter,

59
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:00,593
that the world makes sense,

60
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:04,848
that we are more
than the sum of our minutes,

61
00:03:04,848 --> 00:03:07,350
days and years on this planet.

62
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:10,562
The research on meaningfulness in life

63
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:14,649
suggests there are three big ideas
associated with meaningfulness in life.

64
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:18,361
The first big idea is coherence.

65
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:20,780
The world needs to feel coherent.

66
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,282
After winter comes spring.

67
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:23,825
After spring comes summer.

68
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:25,118
You get up in the morning,

69
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,786
brush your teeth, have breakfast,

70
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:28,705
get the kids off to school, go to work.

71
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:32,792
Those little routines
make the world feel knowable,

72
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,879
predictable, coherent.

73
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,548
Now when you think
about personal achievement,

74
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,426
it does create, sometimes,
this experience of coherence,

75
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:44,220
because we achieve within a framework.

76
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:46,890
I understood what they expected
of me for tenure.

77
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:49,392
I understood that if I got
my papers published,

78
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:51,102
I did well in the classroom,

79
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:53,688
talked to the right people,
did all the networking,

80
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,607
there was a good chance I'd get tenure.

81
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:58,276
If you're trying to lose
weight, you understand

82
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:02,280
if you change your diet, you exercise,
the weight will come off.

83
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:03,740
Or at least we hope so.

84
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:04,949
(Laughs)

85
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,701
Now those things,

86
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:10,121
that framework gives the world
a sense of coherence.

87
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:15,335
Second big idea associated
with meaningfulness in life:

88
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:17,420
purpose.

89
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:21,132
Now, sometimes, people use
the term purpose as a synonym

90
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:22,300
for meaning in life.

91
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:24,427
And that's not how I mean it here.

92
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:28,306
Purpose is a way of thinking
about what your life can be and should be

93
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:29,682
in the future.

94
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:32,185
It's a way of directing your actions.

95
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:33,520
It gives you goals.

96
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:36,439
When you get up in the morning,
you know what you need to do.

97
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:39,776
Here's where the drive for personal
achievement is strongest.

98
00:04:39,818 --> 00:04:40,985
It's clearest.

99
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:43,029
When I was worried about tenure,

100
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:46,074
I knew exactly what I needed to do
when I got up in the morning.

101
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:49,035
When you have a goal,
when you're trying to achieve something,

102
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:52,580
you have a clarity about what you should
do, how to direct your behavior.

103
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,708
So that's the second
big idea, it's purpose.

104
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,669
Now the third big idea,

105
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,296
by many considered
to be the most important,

106
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:02,340
is significance.

107
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:04,592
And the way I like to think
about significance

108
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:08,471
is the sense that you can
transcend yourself,

109
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:10,974
that you are more
than what you are right now,

110
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:13,768
that you will continue to matter
into the future,

111
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:15,311
beyond this moment.

112
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,232
This is where I think personal
achievement falls short.

113
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:24,571
By definition, personal achievement
focuses on you, to focus on the self.

114
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:28,950
And if that's all there is,
it's difficult to have significance.

115
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,326
OK.

116
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:32,996
So now I want to think
about meaningfulness in life

117
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:34,831
and significance in particular.

118
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:38,251
It brings to mind a quote
attributed to Leonardo da Vinci.

119
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:39,502
Some of you might know it.

120
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:43,381
So Leonardo da Vinci was purported
to have said, on his deathbed ...

121
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:49,012
"I have offended God and mankind,

122
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:52,849
because my work did not achieve
the quality it should have."

123
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:58,730
Now I wasn’t there, so I don’t know
if he said that exactly in that way.

124
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:00,023
But here’s the thing:

125
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:02,942
you can imagine it, you understand it.

126
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:06,821
You understand what it means to have
even the most glorious achievements

127
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:10,158
and still ask, is this enough?

128
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,328
Is this it? Is this all I add up to?

129
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:21,085
When I look back and think
about my time early on in my career,

130
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:23,171
I think about when did it feel meaningful.

131
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:24,964
What gave me a sense of meaning?

132
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:28,217
What I think about were my PhD students.

133
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,014
So one of the things that faculty do
is train the next generation of faculty.

134
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:36,225
And so you have PhD students
for a significant amount of time,

135
00:06:36,225 --> 00:06:38,519
often could be five to six years.

136
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:40,605
And the relationships are pretty intense.

137
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:43,650
So let me tell you about my first
student, Miguel Unzueta.

138
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:48,321
So Miguel was born in El Paso, Texas,
in a relatively low-income area.

139
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,907
Really smart kid. Does well in school,

140
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:53,201
ends up at the University
of Texas at Austin,

141
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:54,869
which is a great university.

142
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:58,665
Does well there, eventually ends up
in the PhD program at Stanford.

143
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:01,292
So Miguel gets there the year before I do.

144
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:04,212
And by his own account,
he's having a tough time.

145
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:05,380
It's a little rough,

146
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:08,424
in part because he doesn't have
the cultural capital

147
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:10,843
that many people
that go places like Stanford have.

148
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:14,555
He doesn't understand how the place works,
so he's struggling a little bit.

149
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:19,268
Now when I arrive, I’m really impressed,
because he’s so smart, he’s ambitious,

150
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,855
and he's asking questions and interested
in things that I'm interested in.

151
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:24,857
So I'm really excited to work with him.

152
00:07:24,857 --> 00:07:28,069
And so we started to work together
and again, it's really intense.

153
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,821
I'm working with him for four years.

154
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:32,865
We see each other almost every day
for those four years.

155
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:36,619
And some days, we're working together
10 to 12 hours a day.

156
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:39,163
So it's a very intense experience.

157
00:07:39,163 --> 00:07:41,290
And what I remember about that time

158
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,961
was that I was really worried
about doing enough

159
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:47,005
to make sure he would be successful.

160
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:49,132
I was concerned,
"Am I being a good advisor?

161
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:50,633
Am I giving him what he needs?

162
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:53,219
Am I helping him in his story?"

163
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,596
Now keep in mind I want to get tenure.

164
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:57,807
I still think I'm going to get fired.

165
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,475
So even with that fear,

166
00:07:59,517 --> 00:08:02,228
I'm worried about what do I need to do

167
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,190
to make sure Miguel can continue
in his story and his journey.

168
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,987
And by the way, he did.
He's been great. He got a job.

169
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:14,282
He's been a professor
now for over 15 years at UCLA.

170
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:17,160
He's had serious leadership
roles at his university,

171
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:21,164
and I'm incredibly proud that I got
a chance to be a little part of that.

172
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:24,083
What do I take from that?

173
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:29,589
I take from that is that relationships
are what provide us meaning.

174
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,466
And my guess is you already knew that.

175
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:34,093
I'm saying something
a little bit more than that.

176
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:36,721
Not just that relationships
provide meaning,

177
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:43,519
but that being a part of a story
that is not your own provides meaning.

178
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:48,524
Being a part of a story that is not
your own provides meaning.

179
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:52,904
So where does this leave us?

180
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:56,240
One, I think personal 
achievement is great.

181
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,117
Like, I love my personal achievements.

182
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,412
I'm really happy with my life.
I think it's turned out OK.

183
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:05,083
I wish incredible personal
achievements for all of you.

184
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:07,752
So I think that personal
achievement is fantastic.

185
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:10,838
However, sometimes ...

186
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,260
we replace the deep human need for meaning

187
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,722
with chasing of personal achievement,

188
00:09:19,722 --> 00:09:23,142
and it's a problem when we confuse
those two things.

189
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:25,561
And the reason they get confused,

190
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:27,814
the reason it's easy to confuse them

191
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:30,983
is because personal achievement
is easy to quantify.

192
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:34,153
You know if you got that job,
if you bought that home,

193
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:35,905
you know what your salary is.

194
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:39,534
It's easy to see and it feels comfortable
to chase things you understand

195
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:40,993
and you can achieve.

196
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:42,203
That's one reason.

197
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:46,374
The other reason is that personal
achievement feels good.

198
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,793
Personal achievement feels good.

199
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,586
We think what we want is happiness,

200
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:53,172
and personal achievement
provides a hit of happiness.

201
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:57,176
It feels fantastic
when you make that achievement.

202
00:09:57,176 --> 00:10:00,346
Getting meaning doesn't
necessarily feel that way.

203
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:02,849
For example, studies find that parents

204
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,976
who spend more time
parenting their children

205
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:06,769
report more meaningfulness in life,

206
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,938
but not necessarily more happiness.

207
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:10,106
(Laughter)

208
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:12,275
So these things are not the same.

209
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:17,113
So if you want more meaning in life,
what is there to do?

210
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:22,660
One, look for opportunities
to participate in others' stories.

211
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:25,163
And it's funny I'm saying this

212
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:27,456
as I'm standing
on this stage in the circle,

213
00:10:27,456 --> 00:10:29,500
but there's a lot of main
character energy,

214
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,377
I would argue, in this room right now.

215
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:33,546
(Laughter)

216
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:35,173
It's fantastic, I love it.

217
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:40,303
However, you might try
a little supporting actor energy,

218
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:41,846
if you want meaning.

219
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:44,599
Play a supporting role
in other people’s lives.

220
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,808
That's number one.

221
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,938
Two, accept that the pursuit of meaning

222
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,524
may not generate happiness.

223
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,111
The pursuit of meaning
might not generate happiness.

224
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:59,614
In fact, it might be uncomfortable.

225
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:03,159
It turns out that meaning
is more associated

226
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,496
with the self providing for others
than providing for you, for yourself.

227
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:09,582
And that's sometimes a hard thing to do.

228
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:14,712
Expending effort, emotional energy

229
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:17,757
on behalf of something
that is not going to return happiness

230
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:22,053
is not something that we tend
to think of as a good use of our time.

231
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:24,764
But it turns out it does produce meaning.

232
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:29,310
So let me let me say
just a couple more things

233
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:31,604
One ...

234
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:36,484
I think the human need
and pursuit of meaning

235
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:38,736
is both beautiful and profound,

236
00:11:38,736 --> 00:11:42,156
because when you have
meaning in your life,

237
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:46,911
that means that someone else
gave you the opportunity

238
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:49,413
to participate in a story
that is not your own.

239
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:55,086
And for the meaning you have in your life,
you should feel a deep gratitude

240
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:58,714
for the people who have allowed you
to participate in the story

241
00:11:58,756 --> 00:12:00,216
that it was not your own.

242
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:02,260
On the other side,

243
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:05,179
when you allow people
to participate in your life,

244
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:08,266
you're giving them the opportunity
to generate meaning.

245
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:14,397
And so in that way, the deep, deep human
need for meaning connects us in a circle,

246
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:20,569
I think a beautiful and profound circle
of generosity and gratitude.

247
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:25,783
And so right now here, I'm deeply grateful
that you all have let me

248
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:28,369
participate in your stories.

249
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:30,121
And that's deeply meaningful for me.

250
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:31,372
Thank you for that.

251
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:37,920
(Applause)

252
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:41,632
The theme of this conference
is "The Brave and the Brilliant."

253
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:48,264
I think that one way that we can
experience or be brave

254
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:53,144
is by accepting the fact that our personal
achievements, what we're capable of,

255
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:55,479
the things that we've done,

256
00:12:55,521 --> 00:13:00,693
pale in comparison to the effect
we have on other people

257
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:02,445
and what that does in the world.

258
00:13:03,112 --> 00:13:08,451
(Applause)

259
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:12,371
And that is, you go through the world
with all of your brilliance,

260
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:14,832
and I mean that in terms of light,

261
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:17,918
as you go through the world,
lighting the world,

262
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:21,297
when you interact with other people
and you illuminate them

263
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:24,925
and help them shine more brightly,

264
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,802
that's how the world gets illuminated.

265
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:28,971
That's how we bring up the lights.

266
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:31,349
And the world, obviously,
desperately needs that.

267
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,060
And in return, what you get is meaning,

268
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:35,603
because when we're gone,

269
00:13:35,644 --> 00:13:38,064
all of the accomplishments
will mean nothing.

270
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:40,900
The only thing that will be left
of you when you're gone --

271
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,693
and we all will be gone eventually --

272
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:44,320
the only thing will be left of you

273
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,655
is the role you played
in other people's stories,

274
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:48,366
what you leave with other people,

275
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:51,577
how that reverberates through time.

276
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:53,245
And that is a beautiful thing,

277
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:54,914
and I wish all of that for you.

278
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:56,207
Thank you.

279
00:13:56,207 --> 00:14:02,171
(Cheers and applause)
