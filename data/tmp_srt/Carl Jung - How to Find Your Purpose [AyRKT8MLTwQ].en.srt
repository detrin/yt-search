1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,900
Your purpose is the reason you are here on
Earth.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,530
It’s the thing that you were built for.

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,430
So it’s an incredibly important thing to
figure out, because it’s the thing that

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,230
guides you.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,780
Without a purpose, you’re lost.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,680
You have no North Star.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,300
Your life will feel meaningless.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,590
And so today I’m going to talk about how
to discover your purpose according to the

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,640
philosophy of Carl Jung.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,260
While writing what is now widely considered
his central work, The Red Book, Jung discovered

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,000
the purpose of his own life.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,640
But he didn’t just discover the purpose
of his own life.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,340
He also discovered where purpose comes from
for all of us.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,680
And based on my understanding of The Red Book,
Jung says that your purpose is found in performing

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,180
voluntary self-sacrifice.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,340
What would you willingly sacrifice yourself
for?

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:14,040
This means that your purpose isn’t found
in money, car, clothes, status, or any other

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,250
self-serving pleasure, but rather, your purpose
is found in the thing that you would willingly

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,170
suffer for.

20
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,360
Your purpose lies in serving something that
you deem as greater and more valuable than

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,990
your own existence.

22
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,060
But what if you can’t find anything greater
or more valuable than your own existence?

23
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,270
Then you will experience life as meaningless
and empty.

24
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:49,700
A modern proverb states that life only promises
us two things: death and taxes.

25
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,360
And what does that mean?

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,369
It means that life demands a sacrifice from
us all.

27
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,729
Death and taxes are both a form of self-sacrifice.

28
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,409
All life is born to be sacrificed in some
way.

29
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,780
We’re not getting out of this thing called
life without sacrificing ourselves.

30
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:18,440
Even the food that we eat is, in some way,
sacrificed for our own continued existence.

31
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:25,069
And so if you have nothing greater than yourself
to sacrifice your time and energy for, you

32
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:29,870
end up investing all your life force into
yourself.

33
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:36,110
But since you eventually have to be sacrificed,
all the energy that you invest in yourself

34
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,129
essentially just goes to waste.

35
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:45,350
And so if all your energy is just going to
be wasted, that makes your life meaningless.

36
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,790
Without a North Star or purpose outside of
yourself, your life just becomes empty and

37
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,989
meaningless suffering.

38
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:58,510
But if you find something worth sacrificing
yourself for, worth serving and dedicating

39
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,290
your life too, then your suffering becomes
meaningful, and when your suffering becomes

40
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,571
meaningful, in some way, as both Friedrich
Nietzsche and Viktor Frankl have noted, it

41
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:14,190
ceases to be suffering.

42
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,019
And you know this idea is true when you see
it.

43
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:22,711
If you see someone willing to sacrifice themselves
for something greater than themselves, you

44
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:26,410
tend to think that they’ve found their purpose.

45
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:32,180
When Socrates was imprisoned by his people,
he had a chance to run and escape.

46
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:38,740
But he willingly sacrificed himself for the
principles of truth, justice, and honor.

47
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:44,250
By sacrificing his own life, he believed that
he was doing what was necessary to serve his

48
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,580
city: Athens.

49
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,280
Jesus willingly sacrificed himself for the
good of humanity.

50
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,000
And Cato, who in some ways can be thought
of as the Roman Socrates, sacrificed his life

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,920
as a final resistance against Caesar’s rule,
because he refused to serve under someone

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,269
he viewed as a tyrant.

53
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,200
He sacrificed himself for the principles of
liberty and freedom.

54
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,959
And regardless of what you think of these
three names, there’s one thing you can’t

55
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,500
deny: these men all had a purpose.

56
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,030
They were on a mission.

57
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:26,810
And the reason you know that is because they
all found something more important than themselves

58
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,230
that they thought it was worth sacrificing
their own lives for.

59
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:37,500
But we don’t need to go to big historic
examples to find people who found something

60
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,830
worth sacrificing themselves for.

61
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,910
This happens everyday.

62
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,000
There are mothers who sacrifice themselves
for their children, missionaries for their

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,130
church, cops for justice, activists for equality,
and soldiers for freedom.

64
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:59,850
Every day, people find something worth sacrificing
themselves for, and by doing so, they discover

65
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,770
their own purpose.

66
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,539
So what does it look like to implement Carl
Jung’s wisdom of voluntary self-sacrifice

67
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:11,070
into our own lives?

68
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:17,040
We can take it day by day and dedicate ourselves
to the service of others in a way we would

69
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,170
be willing to do.

70
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,550
We can serve others in a way that we would
want to serve them, in a way that we would

71
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,940
be happy to wake up each day and do.

72
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:34,100
We can create something that we would be willing
to completely sacrifice ourselves for, because

73
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,520
eventually, we will be forced to.

74
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,620
That is what life demands of us all.

75
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,690
But if you don’t discover your purpose,
your life becomes a forced sacrifice, and

76
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,790
a forced sacrifice is felt as tyrannical and
oppressive.

77
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,480
You’ll start to experience life as a great
evil.

78
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,259
But if you discover your purpose, your life
becomes a voluntary sacrifice.

79
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:08,460
And a voluntary sacrifice, such as that of
a mother for her child, is felt as incredibly

80
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,080
meaningful.

81
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,690
And so if you discover your purpose, you will
experience life as incredibly meaningful and

82
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,690
good.

83
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:23,280
So I’ll ask again: what would you willingly
sacrifice yourself for?

84
00:06:23,280 --> 00:07:48,169
That’s where your purpose lies.
