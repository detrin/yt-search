1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,488
People want to know the meaning of life and the
significance of their life in this world. 

2
00:00:05,488 --> 00:00:10,528
some of\h\hthem come from religious angles, some are secular,\h
but everybody's got this burning issue. \h\h

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,643
here's how I have dealt with it.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,730
so often people say I'm\h
looking for meaning.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:23,546
implying that meaning is something out there, waiting to be found by you.

6
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:25,329
is it under a rock,

7
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,033
behind a tree,

8
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,920
in a monastery,

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,812
you go looking for it.

10
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:34,800
and I'm not satisfied\h
with that as a solution to the question.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,154
I think we have the power to create meaning in\h
our life.

12
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:44,358
But why do we long to live forever?

13
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:48,345
we want to live forever because we fear death.

14
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:53,752
we fear death because we are born knowing only life.

15
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,918
yet we don't fear having never been born.

16
00:00:57,918 --> 00:01:01,665
while it's surely better to be alive than dead.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,120
it's even better to be alive at all than to not\h 
ever exist. \h\h

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,441
religion through the ages, has offered detailed accounts for what happens after death.

19
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:16,467
for some, it includes what happened before you were born.

20
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:19,400
a basic tenet of reincarnation.

21
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:24,800
science\h
doesn't have much to say about Valhalla or Elysium

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,746
or Hades or Heaven or Hell or the spirits of\h
your ancestors.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,278
The methods and tools of science do however, make cold concrete statements

24
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:39,110
about\hwhat happens when you die.

25
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:44,885
upon death, there is no evidence that you experience the consciousness

26
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:47,110
you\henjoyed while alive.

27
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:53,612
the electrochemical source of all your thoughts feelings and sensory awareness\h
of the universe

28
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:57,703
your brain,  which normally lights up an MRI

29
00:01:57,703 --> 00:02:00,000
becomes starved of oxygen.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,057
we know\hthat's you disappearing, because people who experience a series of ultimately fatal strokes

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,924
tragically and systematically lose function of their mind and body.

32
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:15,000
as they descend into a state\h
of non-existence.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,329
that's not as odd as it sounds were you conscious before you were conceived?

34
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:25,000
did\hyou complain where am I?  how come I'm not on Earth?

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,259
no, you simply didn't exist.

36
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:34,715
that most people who\h
could ever exist, will never even be conceived.

37
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:43,322
each of us, for all practical purposes, is unique\h
in the universe now and forever.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,045
being alive is the time to celebrate being alive. every waking\h
moment.

39
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,297
all along the way,

40
00:02:52,297 --> 00:03:00,000
why not strive to make the world a better place today than yesterday.\h
simply for the privilege of having lived in it.

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,200
I recognized long ago,  that in a\h
free society where I'm not enslaved\h\h

42
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:15,000
and I'm not you know, an indentured\h
servant and I have some freedom of choice.

43
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:22,569
That I have the power to manufacture\h
meaning in my life.

44
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,875
I can make decisions about my own life that create the meaning.

45
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:34,901
for\hme, a meaningful life is learning something new tomorrow that I didn't know yesterday.

46
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,906
otherwise it's a wasted day.

47
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:43,525
you know the prisoner  who puts x's in the boxes\h
on the wall for the day they get out.

48
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:48,297
I have that in my head and the day that I get\hout
is the day I die. all right.

49
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:54,344
and what these boxes remind you of is every day you're\h
alive you're one day closer to death.

50
00:03:54,915 --> 00:04:02,186
so there's one fewer days in there to accomplish\h
something that you might might have wanted to accomplish.

51
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:11,640
so I want to keep learning about\h
our world about each other about things I don't otherwise know about.

52
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,311
so one of my measures\h
of meaning is how much more do I know about the world tomorrow than I did yesterday.

53
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:24,719
because\halmost any path you take will make you wiser as a person.

54
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:29,218
so I value wisdom that gives\h
meaning to my life.

55
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:33,999
so that's one source of meaning.

56
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:37,419
another, and it's directly traceable\h
to my parents.

57
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,552
But I'd like to also think it's traceable to

58
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:42,163
Common Sense.

59
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:49,585
is spend a little\h
bit of your life lessening the suffering of others.

60
00:04:52,851 --> 00:05:02,273
in my day, in a week do something that lessens the suffering of someone\h
else.

61
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:06,778
however trifling that gesture is.

62
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:13,038
that's an infusion of good.

63
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:22,159
yeah I'm value judging it I'm saying yes\h
it is a good thing to lessen the suffering of others.

64
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:23,566
I'm declaring that.

65
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:26,397
I try not\h
to ever put opinions out there but it's my opinion

66
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:29,260
that if you lessen the\h
suffering of others

67
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:33,345
you make a better world.

68
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:39,778
and don't we all want to live in a better\h
world.

69
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:46,834
the way I look at it is,

70
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:50,339
it is the knowledge that I'm going to die

71
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:55,939
that creates the\h
focus that I bring to being alive.

72
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:00,132
the urgency of accomplishment.

73
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:09,174
the need to express love now not\h
later.

74
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:14,702
if we live forever why ever even get out of bed in the morning?

75
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:17,849
because you always have 
tomorrow.

76
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:21,746
that's not the kind of life I want to lead.

77
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:30,956
I fear living a life where I could have accomplished something and didn't

78
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:37,345
that's what I fear. I don't fear death.

79
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:44,488
on my deathbed I'd be sad to miss the\h
clever inventions and discoveries

80
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,610
that arise from our Collective human Ingenuity.

81
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,001
presuming the\h
systems that Foster such advances

82
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,041
remain intact.

83
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:59,400
that's what fueled the exponential growth\h
of Science and Technology in my lifetime.

84
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:09,092
our primal urge to keep looking up is surely\h
greater than our Primal urge to keep killing\hone another.

85
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:16,760
if so, then human curiosity and\h
wonder, the twin Chariots of cosmic discovery,\h

86
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,441
will ensure that starry messages continue to\h
arrive.

87
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,208
these insights compel us for our short time on Earth,

88
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:30,420
to become better shepherds of our\h
own civilization.

89
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,529
yes life is better than death.

90
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,575
life is also better than having never been born.

91
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:42,483
but each of us is alive against stupendous odds.

92
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:46,883
we won the lottery, only once.

93
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:53,434
we get to invoke\h
our faculties of reason to figure out how the world works.

94
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:57,147
we also get to smell the flowers.

95
00:07:57,147 --> 00:08:01,806
we get to bask in divine sunsets and sunrises.

96
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:07,004
and gaze deeply into the night skies.

97
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:11,427
I\hbeseech you to treasure up in your hearts

98
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:14,982
these my parting words

99
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:22,065
be ashamed to die until you have won\h
some victory for Humanity.

100
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:29,240
there is the source of meaning.
