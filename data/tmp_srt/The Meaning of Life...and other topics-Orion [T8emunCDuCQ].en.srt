00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,589
gratification that game of hide-and seek
can invest life with more meaning and

324
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:56,599
can invest life with more meaning and
 

325
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,350
can invest life with more meaning and
that's why a lot of people do it but

326
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,360
that's why a lot of people do it but
 

327
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,990
that's why a lot of people do it but
ultimately again if you're seeking

328
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
ultimately again if you're seeking
 

329
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,629
ultimately again if you're seeking
you're seeking on at some point I made

330
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
you're seeking on at some point I made
 

331
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,390
you're seeking on at some point I made
the decision to stop seeking and start

332
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
the decision to stop seeking and start
 

333
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,150
the decision to stop seeking and start
finding and what that on some level

334
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,160
finding and what that on some level
 

335
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,790
finding and what that on some level
means is that

336
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:13,800

 

337
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,350

if I kind of approach this from the

338
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,360
if I kind of approach this from the
 

339
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,749
if I kind of approach this from the
perspective of

340
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
perspective of
 

341
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,390
perspective of
like if there is a meaning to life it

342
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:21,400
like if there is a meaning to life it
 

343
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,869
like if there is a meaning to life it
can't be located in any one particular

344
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:24,879
can't be located in any one particular
 

345
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,110
can't be located in any one particular
place like that wouldn't be fair so many

346
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,120
place like that wouldn't be fair so many
 

347
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,589
place like that wouldn't be fair so many
people would never come to that place

348
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
people would never come to that place
 

349
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,629
people would never come to that place
place and so that would suggest that the

350
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:31,639
place and so that would suggest that the
 

351
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,029
place and so that would suggest that the
meaning of life was just access

352
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
meaning of life was just access
 

353
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,350
meaning of life was just access
inaccessible to the vast majority of

354
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,360
inaccessible to the vast majority of
 

355
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,749
inaccessible to the vast majority of
people and it can't be located at a

356
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
people and it can't be located at a
 

357
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,550
people and it can't be located at a
specific point in time for the same

358
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:37,560
specific point in time for the same
 

359
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,670
specific point in time for the same
reason so if there is a meaning to life

360
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:40,680
reason so if there is a meaning to life
 

361
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,589
reason so if there is a meaning to life
it needs to be experienced or

362
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
it needs to be experienced or
 

363
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,869
it needs to be experienced or
approachable at any given place at any

364
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:45,879
approachable at any given place at any
 

365
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,230
approachable at any given place at any
given time which means I can do it right

366
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
given time which means I can do it right
 

367
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,230
given time which means I can do it right
here and now so I don't need to start I

368
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,240
here and now so I don't need to start I
 

369
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,710
here and now so I don't need to start I
I don't need to keep seeking I can start

370
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:53,720
I don't need to keep seeking I can start
 

371
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,430
I don't need to keep seeking I can start
finding right now right where I'm at and

372
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
finding right now right where I'm at and
 

373
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,189
finding right now right where I'm at and
that was a shift in perspective in my

374
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
that was a shift in perspective in my
 

375
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,230
that was a shift in perspective in my
life

376
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
life
 

377
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,149
life
where rather than seeing it as something

378
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:03,159
where rather than seeing it as something
 

379
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:05,510
where rather than seeing it as something
that was out there that I was missing it

380
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
that was out there that I was missing it
 

381
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,110
that was out there that I was missing it
was something that was right in front of

382
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
was something that was right in front of
 

383
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,670
was something that was right in front of
me that I could come into greater

384
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
me that I could come into greater
 

385
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,029
me that I could come into greater
awareness and direct emotional

386
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:12,039
awareness and direct emotional
 

387
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,909
awareness and direct emotional
experience with does that make

388
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:14,919
experience with does that make
 

389
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,990
experience with does that make
sense now the quote was about the

390
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
sense now the quote was about the
 

391
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,670
sense now the quote was about the
meaning of life and the experience of

392
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
meaning of life and the experience of
 

393
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,149
meaning of life and the experience of
life so I made an episode about this it

394
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:23,159
life so I made an episode about this it
 

395
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,469
life so I made an episode about this it
was called the meaning of life I think

396
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:25,479
was called the meaning of life I think
 

397
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:26,589
was called the meaning of life I think
maybe this is why you're asking me the

398
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:26,599
maybe this is why you're asking me the
 

399
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,430
maybe this is why you're asking me the
question it is I know your channel well

400
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,440
question it is I know your channel well
 

401
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,510
question it is I know your channel well
okay so

402
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:30,520
okay so
 

403
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,670
okay so
one way to approach the meaning of life

404
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:34,680
one way to approach the meaning of life
 

405
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,670
one way to approach the meaning of life
is that life is sort of like

406
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:38,680
is that life is sort of like
 

407
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,750
is that life is sort of like
Disneyland where we all get to go into

experiences there are rides and
concessions and lines and there's kind

414
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:51,959
concessions and lines and there's kind
 

415
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,470
concessions and lines and there's kind
of no right way to do Disneyland like

416
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:55,480
of no right way to do Disneyland like
 

417
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,269
of no right way to do Disneyland like
the person who decides I'm going to ride

every single ride once like that person

00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
of Disneyland and on some level we get
 

439
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,030
of Disneyland and on some level we get
to choose what experiences we have in

maybe I could ride this ride but it
 

449
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,470
maybe I could ride this ride but it
means I'm going to have to wait in line

means I'm going to have to wait in line
 

451

it's like you have to make those

it's like you have to make those

Disneyland and then we go
 

469
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,190
Disneyland and then we go
home and that's what it was like

470

home and that's what it was like
 

471

if you rode the teacups 50 times then

if you rode the teacups 50 times then
the meaning of your life was that like

the meaning of your life was that like
 

475
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,670
the meaning of your life was that like
that was your time in the park and we

476
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:10,680
that was your time in the park and we
 

477
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,069
that was your time in the park and we
discover in retrospect the meaning of

478
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:13,079
discover in retrospect the meaning of
 

479
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,910
discover in retrospect the meaning of
our life by examining the choices that

people the wrong way but moral judgments

a particular goal

the easiest way to approach that is

beach well depends on your goals like if
 

519
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,590
beach well depends on your goals like if
you want to go skiing you should not go

you want to go skiing you should not go
 

521
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,750
you want to go skiing you should not go
to the beach right that's the wrong

to the beach right that's the wrong
 

523
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,629
to the beach right that's the wrong
choice but only in the context of that

choice but only in the context of that
 

525
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,069
choice but only in the context of that
goal like the mountains have their pros

529
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,750

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:20,760
and cons and at the end of the day if
 

531
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,509

you go right or you go left you still go

you go right or you go left you still go
 

533
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,590
you go right or you go left you still go
somewhere and that's your life is where

00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:24,600
somewhere and that's your life is where

you're not cheating you're not

544
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,040
you're not cheating you're not
 

545
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,110
you're not cheating you're not
trying I think it applies to everything

546
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
trying I think it applies to everything
 

547
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,550

business relationships everything oh

548

business relationships everything oh
 

549
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,590
business relationships everything oh
yeah so this will be a tough one

550
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
yeah so this will be a tough one
 

551
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,949
yeah so this will be a tough one
too

553
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,030

um so life is a nested series of games

00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,040
um so life is a nested series of games
 

555
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,629
um so life is a nested series of games
we're all playing many different games

not game can sometimes rub people the

not game can sometimes rub people the
 

563
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,910

rules what that means is that every game
 

569
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,269
rules what that means is that every game
is defined by what you can and cannot do

570
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
is defined by what you can and cannot do

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,629
is defined by what you can and cannot do
otherwise it's not a game it's just

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,310
otherwise it's not a game it's just

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,389
spot you it's like approaching the speed
of light you need to do expend more and

644
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:55,399
of light you need to do expend more and
 

645
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,230
of light you need to do expend more and
more of an effort to actually produce

646
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:57,240
more of an effort to actually produce
 

647
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,710
more of an effort to actually produce
smaller and smaller gains

648
00:13:59,710 --> 00:13:59,720
smaller and smaller gains
 

649
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,710
smaller and smaller gains
and so a person who handicapped

650
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:01,720
and so a person who handicapped
 

651
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,150
and so a person who handicapped
themselves in that way would not be able

652
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,160
themselves in that way would not be able
 

653
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,670
themselves in that way would not be able
to compete at that level they might

654
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
to compete at that level they might
 

655
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,030
to compete at that level they might
compete successfully at a lower level

656
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,040
compete successfully at a lower level
 

657
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,870
compete successfully at a lower level
but not at the highest echelons you're

658
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:09,880
but not at the highest echelons you're
 

659
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,230
but not at the highest echelons you're
not going to Beed to Greatness if you're

660
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,240
not going to Beed to Greatness if you're
 

661
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,749
not going to Beed to Greatness if you're
not pushing the limits of fair and so

662
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:14,759
not pushing the limits of fair and so
 

663
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,069
not pushing the limits of fair and so
the reality is that cheating or let's

664
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:19,079
the reality is that cheating or let's
 

665
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,509
the reality is that cheating or let's
say rule

666
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:20,519
say rule
 

667
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,269
say rule
infractions are a calculated

00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
infractions are a calculated
 

669
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,389
infractions are a calculated
risk and there are certainly times in

risk and there are certainly times in
 

671
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,509

games where the the potential penalty

associated with infringing this rule is
offset by the likely projected gain

offset by the likely projected gain
 

677
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,189
offset by the likely projected gain
associated with doing so or the loss

we I think often inappropriately

760
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,040
we I think often inappropriately
 

761
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,590
we I think often inappropriately
believe that we could

762
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
believe that we could
 

763
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,590
believe that we could
tolerate social disapproval especially

764
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:40,600
tolerate social disapproval especially

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:42,440
at the level that it's capable of
 

767
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,870
at the level that it's capable of
attaining in today's day and age there's

768
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
attaining in today's day and age there's
 

769
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,829
attaining in today's day and age there's
this really interesting study that was

770
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:46,839
this really interesting study that was
 

771
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,150
this really interesting study that was
done a long time ago it's so

772
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,160
done a long time ago it's so
 

773
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,870
done a long time ago it's so
simple like there are no rules about how

774
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:51,880
simple like there are no rules about how
 

775
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,910
simple like there are no rules about how
you stand on an elevator like there are

776
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
you stand on an elevator like there are
 

777
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,069
you stand on an elevator like there are
no laws about that but everyone stands

778
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
no laws about that but everyone stands
 

779
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,870
no laws about that but everyone stands
the same way so there was a

780
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
the same way so there was a
 

781
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,910
the same way so there was a
psychological study that was done a

782
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
psychological study that was done a
 

783
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,230
psychological study that was done a
while ago

784
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:01,240
while ago
 

785
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,710
while ago
where they put like four Confederates in

786
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:05,720
where they put like four Confederates in
 

787
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,829
where they put like four Confederates in
an elevator and had them face backwards

788
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
an elevator and had them face backwards
 

789
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,829
an elevator and had them face backwards

actual study the elevator opens the
 

799
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,669
actual study the elevator opens the
people are facing the back and the

800
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:24,679
people are facing the back and the

954
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:53,640

955
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,230
Conformity but if you live in a society
that might be unstable and polarized and

956
00:20:59,230 --> 00:20:59,240
that might be unstable and polarized and
 

957
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,710
that might be unstable and polarized and
fractious and

958

courage well the issue is that we
actually don't want things to be that

already well what's the point of the
 

1065
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,390
already well what's the point of the
game at that point you know that's not a

00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:30,400
game at that point you know that's not a
 

1067

fun game to
 

1069
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,870
fun game to
play so there has to be kind of

1070
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:33,880
play so there has to be kind of
 

1071
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,870
play so there has to be kind of
appropriate challenge when the game is

1072
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
appropriate challenge when the game is
 

1073
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,950
appropriate challenge when the game is
too hard whether it's a video game or

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:38,960
too hard whether it's a video game or
 

1075
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,390
too hard whether it's a video game or
the game of life people are subject to

the game of life people are subject to
 

1077
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,110
the game of life people are subject to
just rage quitting they might feel like

00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
just rage quitting they might feel like
 

1079
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,950
just rage quitting they might feel like
this is a game that they can't possibly

this is a game that they can't possibly

likelihood of succeeding in okay fair
 

1085
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:52,510
likelihood of succeeding in okay fair
enough but if it's too easy people don't

1086
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:52,520
enough but if it's too easy people don't
 

1087
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,909
enough but if it's too easy people don't
bother to play like we want an

1088
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:53,919
bother to play like we want an
 

1089
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,950
bother to play like we want an
appropriate level of Challenge and

1090
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:55,960
appropriate level of Challenge and
 

1091
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,070
appropriate level of Challenge and
ultimately that's kind of what life does

1092
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080
ultimately that's kind of what life does
 

1093
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,870
ultimately that's kind of what life does
for us organically like life never

1094
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
for us organically like life never
 

1095
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,390

1097
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,190

right if life becomes easy it kind of

1098
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
right if life becomes easy it kind of
 

1099
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,549
right if life becomes easy it kind of

1126
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:42,399
to put new data in front of a algorithm
 

1127
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,950
to put new data in front of a algorithm
and they want that algorithm to get it

1128
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:43,960
and they want that algorithm to get it
 

1129
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,830
and they want that algorithm to get it
right 85% of the time and to make

1130
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:45,840
right 85% of the time and to make
 

1131
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,630
right 85% of the time and to make
mistakes 15% of the time because if the

1132
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:49,640
mistakes 15% of the time because if the
 

1133
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,630
mistakes 15% of the time because if the
algorithm is getting it right more than

1134
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:51,640
algorithm is getting it right more than
 

1135
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,430
algorithm is getting it right more than
85% it's not learning anything and so

1136
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:54,440
85% it's not learning anything and so
 

1137
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,950
85% it's not learning anything and so
it's kind of wasting everybody's time

1138
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:55,960
it's kind of wasting everybody's time
 

1139
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,190
it's kind of wasting everybody's time
because you're not training it to be any

1140
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200
because you're not training it to be any
 

1141
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,870
because you're not training it to be any
better than it already is

1142
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880
better than it already is
 

1143
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,149
better than it already is
and if it's getting less than

1144
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:01,159
and if it's getting less than
 

1145
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,710
and if it's getting less than
85% correct it's creating too much error

1146
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
85% correct it's creating too much error
 

1147
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,789
85% correct it's creating too much error
and confusion so it's counterproductive

1148
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:07,799
and confusion so it's counterproductive
 

1149
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,430
and confusion so it's counterproductive
so actually shooting for that 85% hit

1150
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:10,440
so actually shooting for that 85% hit
 

1151
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,710
so actually shooting for that 85% hit
rate is the optimal learning strategy

1152
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:13,720
rate is the optimal learning strategy
 

1153
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,230
rate is the optimal learning strategy
and generally people are more engaged

1154
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:17,240

1155
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,710

1163
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,070

when people want things to be

when people want things to be
 

1197
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,110
when people want things to be
comfortable it's because things are hard

1198
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
comfortable it's because things are hard

comfortable it's because things are hard
for them in that moment it's like I talk

1200
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:07,480
for them in that moment it's like I talk
 

1201
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,710
for them in that moment it's like I talk
to a lot of folks and sometimes they'll

1202
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:09,720
to a lot of folks and sometimes they'll
 

1203
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,990
to a lot of folks and sometimes they'll
say ory if I could just run away from

1204
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,000
say ory if I could just run away from
 

1205
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,389
say ory if I could just run away from
everything and live on a beach and just

1206
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:16,399
everything and live on a beach and just
 

1207
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:18,590
everything and live on a beach and just
drink out of a coconut my life would be

1208
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:18,600
drink out of a coconut my life would be
 

1209
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,230
drink out of a coconut my life would be
okay I don't think that's true I think

1210
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,240
okay I don't think that's true I think
 

1211
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,870
okay I don't think that's true I think
that they could do that maybe for a few

1212
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
that they could do that maybe for a few
 

1213
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,470
that they could do that maybe for a few
days maybe a week at most and then

1214
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
days maybe a week at most and then
 

1215
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,630
days maybe a week at most and then
they're going to get bored but they're

1216
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
they're going to get bored but they're
 

1217
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,950
they're going to get bored but they're
speaking out of their own exhaust in the

1218
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960
speaking out of their own exhaust in the
 

1219
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,230
speaking out of their own exhaust in the
moment so sometimes I tell people that

1220
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:31,240
moment so sometimes I tell people that
 

1221
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,870
moment so sometimes I tell people that
you need to rest before you quit maybe

1222
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:33,880
you need to rest before you quit maybe
 

1223
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,389
you need to rest before you quit maybe
your fantasy about running away or

1224
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:36,399
your fantasy about running away or
 

1225
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:37,950
your fantasy about running away or
leaving it all behind is really just a

1226
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:37,960
leaving it all behind is really just a
 

1227
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,310
leaving it all behind is really just a
function of the fact that you're tired

1228
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,320
function of the fact that you're tired
 

1229
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,909
function of the fact that you're tired
right now and when you rest you'll have

1230
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:40,919
right now and when you rest you'll have
 

1231
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:44,669
right now and when you rest you'll have
a much different relationship to

1232
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:44,679
a much different relationship to
 

1233
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:47,549
a much different relationship to
whatever you're dealing with in your

1234
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:47,559
whatever you're dealing with in your

1239
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,389
Hill I love that guy you have enemies
good that means you've stood up for

1240
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:55,399
good that means you've stood up for
 

1241
00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:00,470
good that means you've stood up for
something sometime in your life mhm m

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,669
not stood for anything of interest to
anyone people sometimes

anyone people sometimes

anyone people sometimes
think

1252
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
think
 

1253
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,830
think
that only bad people have enemies that's

1254
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:20,840
that only bad people have enemies that's
 

1255
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,389
that only bad people have enemies that's
not true like some of the best

1256
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:23,399
not true like some of the best
 

1257
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:25,870
not true like some of the best
unfortunately some of the best people

1258
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:25,880
unfortunately some of the best people
 

1259
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,669
unfortunately some of the best people
throughout history that I'm aware of not

1260
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:27,679
throughout history that I'm aware of not
 

1261
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,430
throughout history that I'm aware of not
only had enies but they

1262
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
only had enies but they
 

1263
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,350
only had enies but they
were killed by their enemies I

1264
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:32,360
were killed by their enemies I
 

1265
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,029
were killed by their enemies I
mean and I don't think that they

1266
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
mean and I don't think that they
 

1267
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,669
mean and I don't think that they
attracted those enemies because their

1268
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:36,679
attracted those enemies because their
 

1269
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:38,789
attracted those enemies because their
views were

1270
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:38,799
views were
 

1271
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,990
views were
incorrect

1272
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,000
incorrect
 

1273
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,950
incorrect
so I don't think we should seek out

1274
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:43,960
so I don't think we should seek out
 

1275
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,750
so I don't think we should seek out
having enemies I I think it might be a

1276
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:46,760
having enemies I I think it might be a
 

1277
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,789
having enemies I I think it might be a
good practice to not have any enemies

1278
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:49,799
good practice to not have any enemies
 

1279
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:53,110
good practice to not have any enemies
yourself but to be comfortable being

1280
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,120
yourself but to be comfortable being
 

1281
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,110
yourself but to be comfortable being
other people's enemy does that make

1282
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120

transformation people took the

intensity breaking things down that's
 

1531
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:46,350
intensity breaking things down that's
actually what happens when you melt

1532
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:46,360
actually what happens when you melt

actually what happens when you melt
something right is that the energy

1534
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,240
something right is that the energy
 

1535
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,830
something right is that the energy
dissipates the bonds between the

1536
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:51,840
dissipates the bonds between the
 

1537
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,110
dissipates the bonds between the
molecules and they start to shift which

1538
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,120
molecules and they start to shift which
 

1539
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,350
molecules and they start to shift which
is a

1540
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,360
is a
 

1541
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,389
is a
liquid that breaking down

1542
00:33:58,389 --> 00:33:58,399
liquid that breaking down
 

1543
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,470
liquid that breaking down
is necessary to reconstitute the

1544
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:01,480
is necessary to reconstitute the
 

1545
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,590
is necessary to reconstitute the
molecules in a different structure to

1546
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
molecules in a different structure to
 

1547
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,950
molecules in a different structure to
build something back up sometimes it's

1548
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:05,960
build something back up sometimes it's
 

1549
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,030
build something back up sometimes it's
not possible to build without

1550
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,040
not possible to build without
 

1551
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,589
not possible to build without
breaking that's why sometimes breakdowns

1552
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:10,599
breaking that's why sometimes breakdowns
 

1553
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,349
breaking that's why sometimes breakdowns
can become breakthroughs and you never

1554
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:12,359
can become breakthroughs and you never
 

1555
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,349
can become breakthroughs and you never
really know what's going to happen to

1556
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:14,359
really know what's going to happen to
 

1557
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:16,069
really know what's going to happen to
people while they're still above ground

1558
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:16,079
people while they're still above ground
 

1559
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,270
people while they're still above ground
you

1560
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,280
you
 

1561
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,710
you
know

1562
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:19,720
know
 

1563
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,750
know
so the whole

1564
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:21,760
so the whole
 

1565
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,790
so the whole
alchemical metaphor is about the

1566
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
alchemical metaphor is about the
 

1567
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,790
alchemical metaphor is about the
spiritual transformation to become gold

1568
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:27,800
spiritual transformation to become gold
 

1569
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,629
spiritual transformation to become gold
which

1570
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:28,639
which
 

1571
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,510
which
is you know the attribute of the sun

1572
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:31,520
is you know the attribute of the sun
 

1573
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,109
is you know the attribute of the sun
which is Divinity which is light which

1574
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:34,119
which is Divinity which is light which
 

1575
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,389
which is Divinity which is light which
is beauty which is

1576
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:37,399
is beauty which is
 

1577
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:40,829
is beauty which is
effulgence and that's something that at

1578
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:40,839
effulgence and that's something that at
 

1579
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:42,109
effulgence and that's something that at
least

1580
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:42,119
least
 

1581
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,470
least
theoretically is a pathway that's open

1582
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:44,480
theoretically is a pathway that's open
 

1583
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,829
theoretically is a pathway that's open
to all human beings but it's very

1584
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:46,839
to all human beings but it's very
 

1585
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,149
to all human beings but it's very
difficult to

1586
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:48,159
difficult to
 

1587
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,829
difficult to
understand you might ask well Orion why

1588
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:50,839
understand you might ask well Orion why
 

1589
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,030
understand you might ask well Orion why
didn't they make it easier to understand

1590
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,040
didn't they make it easier to understand
 

1591
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,669
didn't they make it easier to understand
like maybe more people would take that

1592
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:55,679
like maybe more people would take that
 

1593
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,069
like maybe more people would take that
path if it was easier for people to know

1594
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
path if it was easier for people to know
 

1595
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,230
path if it was easier for people to know
what the to do but it's very

1596
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,240
what the to do but it's very
 

1597
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,750
what the to do but it's very
difficult to know what the to do

1598
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:01,760
difficult to know what the to do
 

1599
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,109
difficult to know what the to do
when you're working with symbols and

1600
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:04,119
when you're working with symbols and
 

1601
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:09,710
when you're working with symbols and
metaphors Etc the reason why is

1602
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:09,720
metaphors Etc the reason why is
 

1603
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,910
metaphors Etc the reason why is
because you want to these wise people

1604
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:12,920

optimists so I think this speaks to the
 

1855
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,790
optimists so I think this speaks to the
importance of Hope optimists have a

1856
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:42,800
importance of Hope optimists have a
 

1857
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,030
importance of Hope optimists have a
vision for the future they believe that

1858
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,040
vision for the future they believe that
 

1859
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,990
vision for the future they believe that
things could be better than they are and

1860
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,000
things could be better than they are and
 

1861
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,790
things could be better than they are and
it's that hope that

1862
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:48,800
it's that hope that
 

1863
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,790
it's that hope that
motivates the effort and the pain and

1864
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:51,800
motivates the effort and the pain and
 

1865
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,910
motivates the effort and the pain and
the struggle of attempting to realize

1866
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:53,920
the struggle of attempting to realize
 

1867
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,270
the struggle of attempting to realize
that in reality so I think there's some

1868
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:56,280
that in reality so I think there's some
 

1869

unhappy part of this is due to the

unhappy part of this is due to the
 

1891
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,069
unhappy part of this is due to the
phenomenon of as no a no agnosia which

1892
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:27,079
phenomenon of as no a no agnosia which
 

1893
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:29,670
phenomenon of as no a no agnosia which
is is a lack of knowledge about one's

1894
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:29,680
is is a lack of knowledge about one's
 

1895
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,349
is is a lack of knowledge about one's
own lack of knowledge it's like dumb

1896
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:31,359
own lack of knowledge it's like dumb
 

1897
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,069
own lack of knowledge it's like dumb
people don't know that they're dumb and

1898
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:33,079
people don't know that they're dumb and
 

1899
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,230
people don't know that they're dumb and
so they don't understand their own

1900
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,240
so they don't understand their own
 

1901
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,630
so they don't understand their own
limitations and so might not be bound in

1902
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:36,640
limitations and so might not be bound in
 

1903
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,309
limitations and so might not be bound in
some of the ways that people who are

1904
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:38,319
some of the ways that people who are
 

1905
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,910
some of the ways that people who are
more intelligent or self-aware might be

1906
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:40,920
more intelligent or self-aware might be
 

1907
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,589
more intelligent or self-aware might be
and so I do think there's this Trope of

1908
00:41:42,589 --> 00:41:42,599
and so I do think there's this Trope of
 

1909
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,069
and so I do think there's this Trope of
people who think deeply they tend to be

1910
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:45,079
people who think deeply they tend to be
 

1911
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:46,990
people who think deeply they tend to be
more Melancholy or depressed or

1912
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,000
more Melancholy or depressed or
 

1913
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,829
more Melancholy or depressed or
pessimistic because they're seeing

1914
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:48,839
pessimistic because they're seeing
 

1915
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,950
pessimistic because they're seeing
reality more accurately there is some

1916
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:50,960
reality more accurately there is some
 

1917
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,309
reality more accurately there is some
truth to that but I don't think that's

1918
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:53,319
truth to that but I don't think that's
 

1919
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:55,750
truth to that but I don't think that's
the whole truth I

1920
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:55,760
the whole truth I
 

1921
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,109
the whole truth I
think that

1922
00:41:58,109 --> 00:41:58,119
think that
 

1923
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:02,030
think that

too I think one way to approach this

too I think one way to approach this
 

2009
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,630
too I think one way to approach this
is that we as a species

2010
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:57,640
is that we as a species
 

2011
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,349
is that we as a species
might be lazier might be more prone to

might be lazier might be more prone to

selfishness might be more subject to the
 

2015
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,349
selfishness might be more subject to the

stultifying effects of comfort than we
 

2017
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,549

might realize a lot of this has to do

2018
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:08,559
might realize a lot of this has to do
 

2019
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:09,870
might realize a lot of this has to do
with the fact that those things

2020
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:09,880
with the fact that those things
 

2021
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,710
with the fact that those things
generally weren't very available to the

2022
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:12,720
generally weren't very available to the
 

2023
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,190
generally weren't very available to the
vast majority of individuals throughout

2024
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:14,200
vast majority of individuals throughout
 

2025
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,549
vast majority of individuals throughout
history and so we would take them when

2026
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:16,559
history and so we would take them when
 

2027
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:18,510
history and so we would take them when
we could it's sort of like why we have

2028
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:18,520
we could it's sort of like why we have
 

2029
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,230
we could it's sort of like why we have
an obesity epidemic is because it was

2030
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:21,240
an obesity epidemic is because it was
 

2031
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,710
an obesity epidemic is because it was
rare throughout most of human

2032
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:22,720
rare throughout most of human
 

2033

evolutionary history to encounter foods

2034
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:25,680
evolutionary history to encounter foods
 

2035
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,150
evolutionary history to encounter foods
that were rich in fats

2036
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:29,160

 

2037
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,910

calories and so there's this tendency to

2038
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:31,920
calories and so there's this tendency to
 

2039
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,549

say okay well I'll eat it now because

who knows when the getting is going to

00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,200
who knows when the getting is going to
 

2043
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,309
who knows when the getting is going to
get this good again and so there are

2044
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:37,319
get this good again and so there are
 

2045
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:38,750
get this good again and so there are
these deep physiological and

2046
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:38,760
these deep physiological and
 

2047
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,510
these deep physiological and
psychological mechanisms that predispose

2048
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:41,520
psychological mechanisms that predispose
 

2049
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,829
psychological mechanisms that predispose
people to certain kinds of foods and

2050
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:44,839
people to certain kinds of foods and
 

2051
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:47,069
people to certain kinds of foods and
that's you know it's more complicated

2052
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:47,079
that's you know it's more complicated
 

2053
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:48,950
that's you know it's more complicated
than that but that is the

2054
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
than that but that is the
 

2055
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,069
than that but that is the
vulnerability that leaves people

2056
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:51,079
vulnerability that leaves people
 

2057
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:54,349
vulnerability that leaves people
susceptible to all kinds of problematic

2058
00:44:54,349 --> 00:44:54,359
susceptible to all kinds of problematic
 

2059
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,750
susceptible to all kinds of problematic
eating behaviors right so I think that

2060
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:57,760
eating behaviors right so I think that
 

2061
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,349
eating behaviors right so I think that
we as a human species like to

2062
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:01,359
we as a human species like to
 

2063
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,990
we as a human species like to
lays we like to feel pleasure we like to

2064
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:06,000
lays we like to feel pleasure we like to
 

2065
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,109
lays we like to feel pleasure we like to
not work

2066
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:07,119
not work
 

2067
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,270
not work
hard because most of our Lives

2068
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:11,280
hard because most of our Lives
 

2069
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,750
hard because most of our Lives
throughout human evolutionary history

2070
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:12,760
throughout human evolutionary history
 

2071
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,309
throughout human evolutionary history
has been effortful and full of toil and

2072
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:16,319
has been effortful and full of toil and
 

2073
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,670
has been effortful and full of toil and
full of struggle and full of pain and so

2074
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:19,680
full of struggle and full of pain and so
 

2075
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,430
full of struggle and full of pain and so
maybe this is comparable it's like who

2076
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:21,440
maybe this is comparable it's like who
 

2077
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,950
maybe this is comparable it's like who
knows when the beginning is going to get

2079
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,829
knows when the beginning is going to get
this good why not just lays about

this good why not just lays about
 

2081
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,349
this good why not just lays about
but it's interesting

2082

because what this suggests is that

because what this suggests is that
potentially humans are about as good as

fragmenting like if this isn't a hard

2142
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:47,960
fragmenting like if this isn't a hard
 

2143
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,390
fragmenting like if this isn't a hard
time then what is a hard time like it

2144
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:50,400
time then what is a hard time like it
 

2145
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,630
time then what is a hard time like it
has to be a war it has to be a famine

00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:52,640
has to be a war it has to be a famine
 

2147
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,630
has to be a war it has to be a famine
maybe it does maybe it does have to be

2148
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:54,640
maybe it does maybe it does have to be
 

2149
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,190
maybe it does maybe it does have to be
that hard of a necessity but

2150
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:58,200
that hard of a necessity but
 

2151
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,589
that hard of a necessity but
clearly it's not good times for a lot of

2152
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:00,599
clearly it's not good times for a lot of
 

2153
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:04,829
clearly it's not good times for a lot of
people right now so where are the strong

2154
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:04,839
people right now so where are the strong
 

2155
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:07,109

men I think there's two ways to approach

2156
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:07,119
men I think there's two ways to approach
 

2157
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,630
men I think there's two ways to approach
this one is that they're coming back

2158
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:09,640
this one is that they're coming back
 

2159
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,230
this one is that they're coming back
like I do think that there is a turning

2160
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:11,240
like I do think that there is a turning
 

2161
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,950
like I do think that there is a turning
of a tide that I've

2162
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:12,960
of a tide that I've
 

2163
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,630
of a tide that I've
sensed very recently like I'm I'm even

2164
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:16,640
sensed very recently like I'm I'm even
 

2165
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,190
sensed very recently like I'm I'm even
cautious about saying that but I do

2166
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:18,200
cautious about saying that but I do
 

2167
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,790
cautious about saying that but I do
think that there is some waking up with

2168
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:21,800
think that there is some waking up with
 

2169
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,710
think that there is some waking up with
respect to this and it's beginning to

2170
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:24,720
respect to this and it's beginning to
 

2171
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,190
respect to this and it's beginning to
propagate throughout the general

2172
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:28,200
propagate throughout the general
 

2173
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,910
propagate throughout the general
population okay so I do think that we

2174
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:30,920
population okay so I do think that we
 

2175
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,870
population okay so I do think that we
will see more strong men in the coming

2176
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:33,880
will see more strong men in the coming
 

2177
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,470
will see more strong men in the coming
days I believe that but the second thing

00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:37,480
days I believe that but the second thing
 

2179
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,710
days I believe that but the second thing
is well

2180
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:39,720
is well
 

2181
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,990
is well

subjective experience
right and on and on and on so the reason

2254
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:19,880
right and on and on and on so the reason
 

2255
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,789
right and on and on and on so the reason
why we might not be seeing as many

2256
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:23,799
why we might not be seeing as many
 

2257
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:25,630
why we might not be seeing as many
strong men coming out of these

2258

strong men coming out of these
 

2259
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,030
strong men coming out of these
objectively hard times times is because

2260
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:28,040
objectively hard times times is because
 

2261
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,910
objectively hard times times is because
of these anesthetizing

2262
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:30,920
of these anesthetizing
 

2263
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,670
of these anesthetizing
snares that exist and have succeeded in

snares that exist and have succeeded in
 

2265
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,589
snares that exist and have succeeded in
entrapping millions and millions of

2319
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,390

anesthetizing principles very prudently

anesthetizing principles very prudently
 

2321
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,910

like it allows us to do things that

00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,270
like it allows us to do things that
would be extremely excruciating or

would be extremely excruciating or
 

2343
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,150
would be extremely excruciating or
difficult to do otherwise but it is

2344
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:28,160
difficult to do otherwise but it is
 

2345
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,789
difficult to do otherwise but it is
absolutely over

applied partly this also has to do with
 

2349
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,349

vacuum for a while like if you were to
 

2357
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,789

00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:55,119
temporarily well what would they do
 

2371
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,390
temporarily well what would they do
instead like you'd have to actively

it's almost like there's a 50-50

2572
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:06,680
it's almost like there's a 50-50
 

2573

it's almost like there's a 50-50
trade-off it seems there's a price you

trade-off it seems there's a price you
 

2575
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,349
trade-off it seems there's a price you
pay and a benefit you reap it's not

00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:10,359
pay and a benefit you reap it's not
 

2577
00:56:10,359 --> 00:56:12,390
pay and a benefit you reap it's not
always 50-50 but you're right there is

2578
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:12,400
always 50-50 but you're right there is
 

2579
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,150
always 50-50 but you're right there is
always a benefit and there's always a

2580
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:14,160
always a benefit and there's always a
 

2581
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,789
always a benefit and there's always a
liability yeah yeah it's not 50/50 but

2582
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:16,799
liability yeah yeah it's not 50/50 but
 

2583

but there's always a
 

2585
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,589
but there's always a
trade-off and with technology look at

2586
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:20,599
trade-off and with technology look at
 

2587
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:22,950
trade-off and with technology look at
all the great things it's brought the

2588
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
all the great things it's brought the

like intrinsically assume meaning if we
 

2723
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,109
like intrinsically assume meaning if we
could do anything at any time nothing is

2724
00:59:24,109 --> 00:59:24,119
could do anything at any time nothing is

things
convenient is often at Cross purposes to

having things
 

2737
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,230
having things
done sometimes things have to be a

done sometimes things have to be a
 

2739
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,390

little inconvenient and a little

2740
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:44,400
little inconvenient and a little
 

2741
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,710
little inconvenient and a little
difficult to like I was saying with the

2742
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:46,720
difficult to like I was saying with the
 

2743
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,950
difficult to like I was saying with the
video game if it's if it's too little of

2744
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:48,960
video game if it's if it's too little of
 

2745
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,390
video game if it's if it's too little of
a challenge people don't want to play

2746
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:50,400
a challenge people don't want to play
 

2747
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,950
a challenge people don't want to play
it's not fun I I do that later there so

2748
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:52,960
it's not fun I I do that later there so
 

2749
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,309
it's not fun I I do that later there so
many better things I could be doing with

2750
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:54,319
many better things I could be doing with
 

2751
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:55,029
many better things I could be doing with
my

2752
00:59:55,029 --> 00:59:55,039
my
 

2753
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,190
my
time so we get rid of some of those

2754
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:58,200
time so we get rid of some of those
 

2755
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,349
time so we get rid of some of those
obstructions I think to our own

2756
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:01,359
obstructions I think to our own
 

2757
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,470
obstructions I think to our own
detriment but we're all still learning

2758
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:03,480
detriment but we're all still learning
 

2759
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,349
detriment but we're all still learning
like the pace of technology is

2760
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:06,359
like the pace of technology is
 

2761
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:10,349
like the pace of technology is
insane and no one's ever had to figure

2762
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:10,359
insane and no one's ever had to figure
 

2763
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:11,990
insane and no one's ever had to figure
out these issues before we're we're

2764
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:12,000
out these issues before we're we're
 

2765
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,870
out these issues before we're we're
figuring out collectively in real time

2766
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:14,880
figuring out collectively in real time
 

2767
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,069
figuring out collectively in real time
maybe we're doing a decent job of it

2768
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:18,079
maybe we're doing a decent job of it
 

2769
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,349
maybe we're doing a decent job of it
like and I think that we'll get better

2770
01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:20,359
like and I think that we'll get better
 

2771
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:22,190
like and I think that we'll get better
at it with

2772
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:22,200
at it with
 

2773
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,950
at it with
time I mean no one really worries

2774
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:24,960
time I mean no one really worries
 

2775
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,150
time I mean no one really worries
about typewriter ribbon jams anymore you

2776
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:28,160
about typewriter ribbon jams anymore you
 

2777
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,950
about typewriter ribbon jams anymore you
know what I'm saying true fun fact about

2778
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:30,960
know what I'm saying true fun fact about
 

2779
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,510
know what I'm saying true fun fact about
typewriters yeah do you know where the

2780
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:32,520
typewriters yeah do you know where the
 

2781
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,390
typewriters yeah do you know where the
querty arrangement comes from no don't

2782
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:35,400
querty arrangement comes from no don't
 

2783
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,710
querty arrangement comes from no don't
you did you ever think about like how

2784
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:36,720
you did you ever think about like how
 

2785
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,349
you did you ever think about like how
they decided why the letters went there

2786
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:39,359
they decided why the letters went there
 

2787
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:40,470
they decided why the letters went there
this this totally speaks to what we're

2788
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:40,480
this this totally speaks to what we're
 

2789
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,109
this this totally speaks to what we're
talking about um the first

2790
01:00:44,109 --> 01:00:44,119
talking about um the first
 

2791
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:46,470
talking about um the first
typewriters actually had the most

2792
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:46,480
typewriters actually had the most
 

2793
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,190
typewriters actually had the most
commonly used English letters on the

2794
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:49,200
commonly used English letters on the
 

2795
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,390
commonly used English letters on the
home row where your fingers rest in

2796
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:51,400
home row where your fingers rest in
 

2797
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,510
home row where your fingers rest in
touch typing they made the most commonly

2798
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:54,520
touch typing they made the most commonly
 

2799
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,630
touch typing they made the most commonly
used letters more convenient

2800
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:56,640
used letters more convenient
 

2801
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,190
used letters more convenient
for typists

2802
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:58,200
for typists
 

2803
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,510
for typists
fingers it's a rational decision right

2804
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:01,520
fingers it's a rational decision right
 

2805
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,390
fingers it's a rational decision right
but what the manufacturers found is

2806
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:03,400
but what the manufacturers found is
 

2807
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,430
but what the manufacturers found is
because those letters were so convenient

2808
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:06,440
because those letters were so convenient
 

2809
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,270
because those letters were so convenient
they kept creating jams in the

2810
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:09,280
they kept creating jams in the
 

2811
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,950
they kept creating jams in the
typewriter you actually we want to

2812
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:11,960
typewriter you actually we want to
 

2813
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,069
typewriter you actually we want to
create some space between each

2814
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:14,079
create some space between each
 

2815
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,109
create some space between each
subsequent type hit or else they get

2816
01:01:17,109 --> 01:01:17,119
subsequent type hit or else they get
 

2817
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,029
subsequent type hit or else they get
jammed and it's much less efficient in

2818
01:01:19,029 --> 01:01:19,039
jammed and it's much less efficient in
 

2819
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:21,670
jammed and it's much less efficient in
the long run so they created the Cy

2820
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:21,680
the long run so they created the Cy
 

2821
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,910
the long run so they created the Cy
arrangement to make certain letters more

2822
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:24,920
arrangement to make certain letters more
 

2823
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,710
arrangement to make certain letters more
inconvenient for typists so that they

2824
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:27,720
inconvenient for typists so that they
 

2825
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,670
inconvenient for typists so that they
could actually get more writing

2826
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:30,680
could actually get more writing
 

2827
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,549
could actually get more writing
done and our keyboards are a vestage of

2828
01:01:34,549 --> 01:01:34,559
done and our keyboards are a vestage of
 

2829
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:35,710
done and our keyboards are a vestage of
those

2830
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:35,720
those
 

2831
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,109
those
typewriters obviously it's not necessary

2832
01:01:38,109 --> 01:01:38,119
typewriters obviously it's not necessary
 

2833
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:39,470
typewriters obviously it's not necessary
to have the letters in that Arrangement

2834
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:39,480
to have the letters in that Arrangement
 

2835
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,750
to have the letters in that Arrangement
anymore for that reason

2836
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:41,760
anymore for that reason
 

2837
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,109
anymore for that reason
but people are already trained yeah on

2838
01:01:45,109 --> 01:01:45,119
but people are already trained yeah on

paths are really

2922
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:33,760
paths are really
 

2923
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,789

one that when you understand who you are

one that when you understand who you are
 

2925
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:39,630
one that when you understand who you are
and how you are related to every other

01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:39,640
and how you are related to every other

and how you are related to every other
person an aspect of created

person an aspect of created
 

2929
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,109
person an aspect of created
reality how can you not devote more of

2930
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:46,119
reality how can you not devote more of
 

2931
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:50,230
reality how can you not devote more of
your time to the service of that

2932
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:50,240
your time to the service of that
 

2933
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,670
your time to the service of that
understanding and how is that

2934
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:52,680
understanding and how is that
 

2935
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,870
understanding and how is that
opportunity not associated with

2936
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:54,880
opportunity not associated with
 

2937
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,510
opportunity not associated with
gratitude which is a form of

2938
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:57,520
gratitude which is a form of
 

2939
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:01,109
gratitude which is a form of
devotion for the opportunity to be alive

2940

devotion for the opportunity to be alive
 

2941
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:02,910
devotion for the opportunity to be alive
in my comprehension that's how those

2942
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:02,920
in my comprehension that's how those
 

2943
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,510
in my comprehension that's how those
three things come to alignment with each

2944
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:07,520
three things come to alignment with each
 

2945
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,069
three things come to alignment with each
other when you actually understand

2946
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:10,079
other when you actually understand
 

2947
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,950
other when you actually understand
reality more

2948
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:11,960
reality more
 

2949
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,069
reality more
clearly it's not even correct that

2950
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:14,079
clearly it's not even correct that
 

2951
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,269
clearly it's not even correct that
you're serving other people like that's

2952
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:17,279
you're serving other people like that's
 

2953
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:22,430
you're serving other people like that's
more of a perception of ego

2954
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:22,440
more of a perception of ego
 

2955
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,150
more of a perception of ego
construction you understand that the

2956
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:26,160
construction you understand that the
 

2957
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,510
construction you understand that the
boundaries between self and other or

2958
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:28,520
boundaries between self and other or
 

2959
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,549
boundaries between self and other or
inside and outside

2960

inside and outside
 

2961
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:34,190
inside and outside
are really fluid and actually

2962
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:34,200
are really fluid and actually
 

2963
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,269
are really fluid and actually
arbitrarily constructed and

01:04:37,269 --> 01:04:37,279
arbitrarily constructed and

01:04:43,069 --> 01:04:43,079
knowledge like no one needs to be taught
 

2969
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,390

on some level to take care of themselves
 

2971
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,710
on some level to take care of themselves
on on a very basic level yeah we need to

2972
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:48,720
on on a very basic level yeah we need to
 

2973
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,150
on on a very basic level yeah we need to
be taught how to present ourselves in a

01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:52,160
be taught how to present ourselves in a
 

2975
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,750
be taught how to present ourselves in a
specific culture but like humans are

2976
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:55,760
specific culture but like humans are
 

2977
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,069
specific culture but like humans are
born with inborn Tendencies for

born with inborn Tendencies for
self-preservation

01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:00,039
self-preservation
 

2981
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:03,269
self-preservation
right but when you expand the conception

2982
01:05:03,269 --> 01:05:03,279
right but when you expand the conception
 

2983
01:05:03,279 --> 01:05:07,109
right but when you expand the conception
of self then your

2984
01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:07,119
of self then your
 

2985
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,269
of self then your
behavior begins to look more and more

2986
01:05:09,269 --> 01:05:09,279
behavior begins to look more and more
 

2987
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:11,829
behavior begins to look more and more
like service to others but it's really

2988
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:11,839
like service to others but it's really
 

2989
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:16,430
like service to others but it's really
not it's it's it service to a a higher

2990
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:16,440
not it's it's it service to a a higher
 

2991
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:21,670
not it's it's it service to a a higher
more expansive conceptualization of

saying why do we not believe that it's a

3202
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:04,520
saying why do we not believe that it's a
 

3203
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,510
saying why do we not believe that it's a
miracle that gravity attracts towards

3204
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:08,520
miracle that gravity attracts towards
 

3205
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,830
miracle that gravity attracts towards
the center of its mass like we just oh

3206
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:10,840
the center of its mass like we just oh
 

3207
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,750
the center of its mass like we just oh
that's just how it's supposed to be like

3208
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:12,760
that's just how it's supposed to be like
 

3209
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,669
that's just how it's supposed to be like
says who like what's your basis of

3210
01:10:16,669 --> 01:10:16,679
says who like what's your basis of
 

3211
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:18,830
says who like what's your basis of
comparison and if your basis of

3212
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:18,840
comparison and if your basis of
 

3213
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,390
comparison and if your basis of
comparison is

3214
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:22,400
comparison is
 

3215
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,430
comparison is
nothingness like attaining to

3216
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:26,440
nothingness like attaining to
 

3217
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,830
nothingness like attaining to
some conceptualization if it's possible

3218
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:28,840
some conceptualization if it's possible
 

3219
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,750
some conceptualization if it's possible
of reality that is not only empty but

3220
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:31,760
of reality that is not only empty but
 

3221
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,149
of reality that is not only empty but
full of the PO potential of ever being

3222
01:10:35,149 --> 01:10:35,159
full of the PO potential of ever being
 

3223
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:37,910
full of the PO potential of ever being
full of anything then everything is

3224
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:37,920
full of anything then everything is
 

3225
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,510
full of anything then everything is
miraculous because in comparison with

3226
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:40,520
miraculous because in comparison with
 

3227
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:43,030
miraculous because in comparison with
that standard nothing should be like

3228
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:43,040
that standard nothing should be like
 

3229
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,270
that standard nothing should be like
there's no rational basis for anything

3230
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:46,280
there's no rational basis for anything
 

3231
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,270
there's no rational basis for anything
even the most ordinary aspect of our

3232

even the most ordinary aspect of our
 

3233
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:52,110
even the most ordinary aspect of our
existence is miraculous so people who

3234
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:52,120
existence is miraculous so people who
 

3235
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,590
existence is miraculous so people who
just think that walking on water it's

3236
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:53,600
just think that walking on water it's
 

3237
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,830
just think that walking on water it's

like well
 

3239
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,390
like well
is miraculous as missing the point it's

3240
01:10:59,390 --> 01:10:59,400

 

3241
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,510

like why don't we consider

01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:02,520
like why don't we consider
 

3243
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,550
like why don't we consider
that it's a miracle that ice

that it's a miracle that ice

sink and the fact that ice
 

3251
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,310

floats actually is probably related to

floats actually is probably related to

the Persistence of Life on this planet

the Persistence of Life on this planet
 

3255
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,350
the Persistence of Life on this planet
more than most people understand because

01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:21,360
more than most people understand because
 

3257
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,990
more than most people understand because
we think that life came out of the the

we think that life came out of the the

01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,110
ocean and if the oce cooled and ice sink
it would sink to the bottom which would

it would sink to the bottom which would
 

3263
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,189
it would sink to the bottom which would
freeze another layer of water which

freeze another layer of water which
 

3265
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:32,830
freeze another layer of water which
would sink to the bottom and ultimately

would sink to the bottom and ultimately
 

3267
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,189
would sink to the bottom and ultimately
the Seas would just potentially be one

the Seas would just potentially be one
 

3269
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,590
the Seas would just potentially be one
mass of ice and no life could

mass of ice and no life could
 

3271
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,110
mass of ice and no life could
potentially thrive in that according to

that every aspect of reality that we

hopefully okay life is pretty miraculous

hopefully okay life is pretty miraculous

it is it's it's

completely
incomprehensible like no one will ever

incomprehensible like no one will ever
be able to understand life and that

be able to understand life and that
 

3303
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,390
be able to understand life and that
might not be the

might not be the

3307
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:23,910
point it's pretty fun to be alive I
think it beats the

think it beats the

think it beats the
