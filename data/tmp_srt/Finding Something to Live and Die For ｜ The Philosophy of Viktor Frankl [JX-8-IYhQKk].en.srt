1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,120
“The meaning of life is to give life meaning.”

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,160
What keeps a human being going?\h
The purest answer to this question\h\h

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,120
is perhaps to be found in the worst of\h
places. Austrian psychiatrist, philosopher,\h\h

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,120
and author Viktor Frankl spent three years in\h
four different concentration camps. He was at\h\h

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,920
the mercy of sadistic SS guards and the so-called\h
“Capos:” prisoners with special privileges who\h\h

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,640
willingly collaborated with the Nazis and\h
were even more ruthless than their masters.\h

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,800
The camp inmates were constantly exposed\h
to famine, sickness, slave labor, and the\h\h

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,440
possibility of punishment or execution. There\h
was no freedom. The prisoners moved around like\h\h

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,120
a defenseless flock of sheep, kicked and beaten\h
by their shepherds, stripped of all human dignity.\h

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,520
What’s left to live for in such a horrible place\h
like a concentration camp? When they’ve taken all\h\h

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,040
your liberties and possessions, and when death\h
at short notice is almost inevitable, is there\h\h

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,520
any reason not to give up on life? Viktor Frankl\h
concluded that there’s always a reason to live\h\h

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,120
even in the worst conditions: there’s always\h
meaning in suffering. And if we can grasp\h\h

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,800
this meaning - this star in the sky - we can\h
overcome even the most painful circumstances.\h

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,360
According to Viktor Frankl, it’s not pleasure nor\h
success and power that essentially drives people;\h\h

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,649
it’s finding something - a purpose,\h
a meaning - to live and even die for.

17
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:50,800
What’s the purpose of my life? What’s the\h
meaning of all this? These questions echo the\h\h

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,520
current societal condition, predominantly\h
in the Western World, in which our lives\h\h

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,600
seem to revolve around working a meaningless job\h
to earn money so we can buy stuff as a means to\h\h

20
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,640
dull our sense of meaninglessness. During times of\h
globalization, secularization, and relative peace,\h\h

21
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,200
we’re less likely to find meaning in being\h
part of a tribe, religious community,\h\h

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,440
or defending our countries and loved ones against\h
neighboring enemies. Everything has become so\h\h

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,200
dull, so pointless, that we engage in rampant\h
consumerism and distraction just not to feel\h\h

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,960
a deep-seated sense of purposelessness that\h
plagues our existence. And before we know it,\h\h

25
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,880
nihilism kicks in, and we begin to ask\h
ourselves: What’s the point? Why keep going?\h

26
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,320
We cannot compare the circumstances of\h
the modern-day Westerner with those who\h\h

27
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,120
lived in the concentration camps during\h
the Second World War. But oddly enough,\h\h

28
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,000
we walk around with similar existential\h
questions and have similar reasons for\h\h

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,280
giving up on life altogether: the lack of\h
purpose, hopelessness, meaninglessness.\h\h

30
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,040
When we’re trapped in what Viktor Frankl\h
called the ‘existential vacuum,’ what awaits us\h\h

31
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,840
is despair. During his days in the concentration\h
camps, he noticed a division between two kinds of\h\h

32
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,320
people: those who had given up on life and those\h
who had not. The first group was more prone to\h\h

33
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:25,120
illness and death; the second group was more\h
likely to survive. The difference? A sense of\h\h

34
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,920
meaning or, more specifically, the discovery of\h
purpose in their unbearable living conditions.\h

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,880
For example, Frankl himself was a doctor\h
and found purpose in helping the inmates who\h\h

36
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,640
suffered from illnesses. One day, he refused an\h
opportunity to escape the camp so he could stay\h\h

37
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:50,480
with his patients. He wasn’t motivated by money,\h
status, power, or even freedom: his purpose,\h\h

38
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,400
in his case taking care of his fellow human beings\h
and not abandoning them, was so important to him\h\h

39
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,720
that he was willing to die for it. His life had\h
become a sacrifice of most profound significance.\h

40
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,480
On the other end, Frankl wrote about those\h
who collapsed under the harsh conditions of\h\h

41
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,000
the camp. They always had the same reasoning\h
for giving up, and I quote: “There’s nothing\h\h

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,360
anymore to expect from life.” End quote. Devoid\h
of meaning and faith that things could turn out\h\h

43
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,560
more favorable, our bodies and minds begin\h
to wither as we’ve lost our will to live.\h

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,680
Frankl wrote about a prisoner who had dreamt about\h
the end of the war and his release. His dream also\h\h

45
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:42,400
revealed the date on which the liberation would\h
happen: March 13th, 1945. He was full of hope. But\h\h

46
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:50,000
when March 13th finally passed, nothing happened.\h
As the prisoner’s prophecy was naive and he had no\h\h

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,080
purpose within the context of his imprisonment, he\h
was struck with disappointment, suddenly got ill,\h\h

48
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,280
and died of typhus shortly after.
But looking at the horrible and hopeless\h\h

49
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,120
circumstances that some people find themselves\h
in, is it fair to expect that they find meaning?\h\h

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,960
Aren’t some situations simply too\h
overpowering, so much so that they\h\h

51
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,600
eliminate one’s responsibility to choose?
When the war was over, Frankl reflected on the\h\h

52
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,920
validity of human liberty during the horrors of\h
the concentration camps. He concluded that we are\h\h

53
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:32,960
indeed able to preserve a “vestige of spiritual\h
freedom” and of “independence of mind” even in\h\h

54
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,160
such terrible conditions of mental and physical\h
stress. Thus, we always have a choice. I quote:

55
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,120
We who lived in concentration camps can remember\h
the men who walked through the huts comforting\h\h

56
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,360
others, giving away their last piece of bread.\h
They may have been few in number, but they offer\h\h

57
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,200
sufficient proof that everything can be taken\h
from a man but one thing: the last of the human\h\h

58
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,840
freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given\h
set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.

59
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,280
End quote.

60
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,800
The ruthless Capos without morality, the sadistic\h
SS guards with no respect for human life,\h\h

61
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,040
the prisoners who lost their will to live, the\h
guards who tried to help the inmates, those who\h\h

62
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,480
found meaning in the deepest of suffering: they\h
were all responsible for their life choices.\h

63
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,400
Hence, regardless of how terrible life is, we\h
still can and must decide in what direction we go.\h\h

64
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,480
Do we choose to betray our people and commit\h
brutal acts to escape torture and death in the\h\h

65
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,920
concentration camps? Do we choose to succumb\h
to peer pressure and hateful ideologies?\h\h

66
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,800
Do we choose to embrace a nihilistic, destructive\h
mindset due to living in a consumerist society\h\h

67
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,440
that seems spiritually and morally bankrupt? Do we\h
choose to become a plaything of our circumstances?\h\h

68
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,400
According to Frankl, the spiritual freedom we have\h\h

69
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,840
(which cannot be taken away) makes life\h
meaningful and purposeful. I quote:

70
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,520
The way in which a man accepts his\h
fate and all the suffering it entails,\h\h

71
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,240
the way in which he takes up his\h
cross, gives him ample opportunity—even\h\h

72
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,960
under the most difficult circumstances—to\h
add a deeper meaning to his life.

73
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,811
End quote.

74
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,840
Imagine having to get out of bed every morning\h
without a meaningful long-term goal. The only\h\h

75
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,040
reason you get up is that you have to get to\h
work and engage in activities you don’t like,\h\h

76
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,600
just to financially support a meaningless\h
existence and the many pointless pleasures\h\h

77
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,000
to cope with it. You blame your past, parents,\h
circumstances, and even your genetics for not\h\h

78
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
having anything going for you. But, in reality,\h
you can still transcend your predicament\h\h

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,280
and find purpose despite any external situation.
The question is, of course: how? Before we get\h\h

80
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,880
into that ‘how’ of meaning, it’s helpful to look\h
at the ‘why’ of meaning. Especially in the current\h\h

81
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,600
age, there’s a tendency to focus on money, status,\h
power, and pleasure rather than a meaningful life.\h\h

82
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,080
But, according to Frankl, these pursuits\h
are ways to cope with an existential vacuum.\h\h

83
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,880
They are a consequence of a lack of meaning. In\h
a society highly concerned with pursuing pleasure\h\h

84
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,400
and achieving wealth, it’s often difficult\h
to realize that these pursuits don’t fill\h\h

85
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,760
our existential emptiness and are only\h
cheap substitutes for what truly matters.\h

86
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,440
A more direct approach for dealing with\h
the pain of meaninglessness we see today\h\h

87
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,480
is the pursuit of ‘happiness.’ In some\h
circles, like the good-vibes-only movement,\h\h

88
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,960
happiness has even become a requirement. Frankl\h
describes a characteristic of American culture:\h\h

89
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:08,560
one is “commanded” and “ordered” to be happy.\h
There’s nothing wrong with ‘happiness,’ of course,\h\h

90
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,760
as happiness is probably the ultimate pleasant\h
state of mind and the eventual by-product\h\h

91
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,880
of following, for example, Stoic and Buddhist\h
teachings. But, so argues Frankl, happiness itself\h\h

92
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:29,040
cannot be pursued, as it must ensue. I quote: One must have a reason to “be happy.” Once the\h\h

93
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,720
reason is found, however, one becomes happy\h
automatically. As we see, a human being is\h\h

94
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,320
not one in pursuit of happiness but rather\h
in search of a reason to become happy, last\h\h

95
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,800
but not least, through actualizing the potential\h
meaning inherent and dormant in a given situation.

96
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,880
End quote. The same goes for success, according\h
to Frankl. Success must also ‘ensue’ and not be\h\h

97
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,800
‘pursued,’ as it’s the unintended side effect\h
of one’s dedication to a more significant cause.\h\h

98
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,440
It must happen. The more we care about\h
it, the less we can focus on our cause,\h\h

99
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,600
and the less likely success will occur. But\h
if we dedicate ourselves to a purpose and\h\h

100
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,880
don’t care about success, the more likely it\h
will happen as a byproduct in the long run.\h

101
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,600
So, it seems that meaning is at\h
the root of happiness and success,\h\h

102
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,000
and the lack of it at the heart\h
of indulgence in and addiction to\h\h

103
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,680
pleasure, money, fame, and power. Having explained\h
this, let’s take a look into the ‘how’ of meaning.

104
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,840
First of all, according to Frankl, the meaning\h
of life depends on the person, the moment, and\h\h

105
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,880
circumstances. So, there’s no one-size-fits-all\h
type of meaning that suits everyone at any time.\h\h

106
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,920
He compares the futile quest for general\h
meaning, to a question posed to a chess champion:\h\h

107
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,680
“Tell me, Master, what is\h
the best move in the world?”\h\h

108
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,720
There’s none. The best move in chess depends\h
entirely on the situation in the game\h\h

109
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,920
and the characteristics of one’s opponent.
We cannot invent the meaning of our existence,\h\h

110
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:21,280
but we can detect it. As Frankl stated, meaning\h
is inherent and dormant in a given situation.\h\h

111
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,840
We can discover our purpose only if we interact\h
with the world or determine what the world needs.\h\h

112
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,040
Frankl wrote that we find out the\h
meaning of life in three different ways:

113
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
(1) by creating a work or doing a deed\h

114
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,160
(2) by experiencing something\h
or encountering someone\h

115
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,200
(3) by the attitude we take\h
toward unavoidable suffering

116
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,800
The first one lies in achievement and\h
accomplishment. Creative pursuits like\h\h

117
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,400
writing a book, painting, sharing stories\h
about our sufferings and life experiences,\h\h

118
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,880
or solving today’s problems with\h
science and technological inventions,\h\h

119
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,160
can help others. We’ll only find out when\h
we get started and engage with the world,\h\h

120
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,080
so other people’s needs become apparent.\h
The benefit of performing good deeds doesn’t\h\h

121
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,360
need an explanation. But it probably doesn’t\h
have to be grandiose; even sharing a small\h\h

122
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,840
piece of bread with a starving inmate can\h
be a profoundly meaningful experience.\h

123
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,040
The second one lies in the connection we have\h
or find with people and things. The experience\h\h

124
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,360
of life itself, caring about the environment and\h
its people, can be meaningful in itself. Frankl\h\h

125
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,480
describes this as love, as he argues that it\h
requires love to know something or someone truly.\h\h

126
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,280
I quote: “The second way of finding a meaning\h
in life is by experiencing something - such as\h\h

127
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:58,480
goodness, truth, and beauty - by experiencing\h
nature and culture, or, last but not least,\h\h

128
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,800
by experiencing another human being in his\h
very uniqueness - by loving him.” End quote.\h

129
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,040
The third one lies in finding meaning in\h
suffering. Frankl gives an example of an elderly\h\h

130
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,880
practitioner who consulted him because of his\h
severe depression after losing his wife. Instead\h\h

131
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,560
of telling him what to do, he asked: “What would\h
have happened, Doctor, if you had died first,\h\h

132
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,040
and your wife would have to survive you?” “Oh,”\h
he said, ”for her, this would have been terrible;\h\h

133
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,280
how would she have suffered!” Frankl pointed\h
out that the Doctor’s wife has been spared from\h\h

134
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:42,240
such suffering, and he spared her by paying the\h
price: that he has survived and now mourns her.\h

135
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,320
We cannot bring back the dead. In many situations,\h
like being imprisoned in a concentration camp,\h\h

136
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,640
there’s isn’t much we can do about the external\h
factors. “When we are no longer able to change a\h\h

137
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:04,560
situation, we are challenged to change ourselves,”\h
Frankl stated. By changing our attitude, we can\h\h

138
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,920
turn adversity into triumph; we can find meaning,\h
even within the worst sufferings imaginable.\h

139
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,160
The philosophy of Viktor Frankl could\h
perhaps be summarized like this:\h\h

140
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,760
‘finding something to live (and even\h
die for) transforms a meaningless,\h\h

141
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,440
hopeless existence into a life worth\h
living, regardless of any circumstances.’

142
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:35,760
Hence, he quoted Nietzsche, saying: “He who\hhas a why to live can bear almost any ‘how.’”
