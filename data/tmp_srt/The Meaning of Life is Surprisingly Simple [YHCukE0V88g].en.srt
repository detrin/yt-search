meaning of life I feel like we are going
 

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,470
meaning of life I feel like we are going
through a time period where there is a

8
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:13,480
through a time period where there is a
 

9
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,670
through a time period where there is a
crisis of meaning so many people seem

10
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:16,680
crisis of meaning so many people seem
 

11
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,429
crisis of meaning so many people seem
like they're alive they're existing

12
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:19,439
like they're alive they're existing
 

13
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,590
like they're alive they're existing
they're living for all intents and

14
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
they're living for all intents and
 

15
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,470
they're living for all intents and
purposes but their life really has no

16
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
purposes but their life really has no
 

17
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,230
purposes but their life really has no
meaning and I think one of the reasons

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,749
meaning and I think one of the reasons
so many of us are devoid of meaning in
