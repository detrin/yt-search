so I was just trying to resolve for

26
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:22,350
so I was just trying to resolve for
 

27
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,740
so I was just trying to resolve for
myself like what could the answer be

28
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:24,750
myself like what could the answer be
 

29
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,720
myself like what could the answer be
right not what is the answer but what

30
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:26,730
right not what is the answer but what
 

31
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,179
right not what is the answer but what
could the answer be and so at a core

32
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:29,189
could the answer be and so at a core
 

33
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:30,740
could the answer be and so at a core
level I was forced to kind of hunting

34
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:30,750
level I was forced to kind of hunting
 

35
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,659
level I was forced to kind of hunting
down all these weird little things and

36
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:32,669
down all these weird little things and
 

37
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:35,299
down all these weird little things and
really understand for myself it's got to

38
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:35,309
really understand for myself it's got to
 

39
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:35,930
really understand for myself it's got to
be personal

40
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:35,940
be personal
 

41
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,670
be personal
right but I'd established for myself

42
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
right but I'd established for myself
 

43
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,979
right but I'd established for myself
what it could and could not be and that

44
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:39,989
what it could and could not be and that
 

45
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,319
what it could and could not be and that
gave me some level of peace so now I

46
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:42,329
gave me some level of peace so now I
 

47
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:43,310
gave me some level of peace so now I
don't have to keep asking that question

48
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,320
don't have to keep asking that question
 

49
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,590
don't have to keep asking that question
what is the meaning of life I mean

50
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:48,600
what is the meaning of life I mean
 

51
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,840
what is the meaning of life I mean
youyou I think the question is more

52
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:50,850
youyou I think the question is more
 

53
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,130
youyou I think the question is more
interesting than the answer everyone

54
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:52,140
interesting than the answer everyone
 

55
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,750
interesting than the answer everyone
should explore this on their own but let

56
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
should explore this on their own but let
 

57
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,459
should explore this on their own but let
me just explore a few parts with you

58
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:55,469
me just explore a few parts with you
 

59
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:56,090
me just explore a few parts with you
right

60
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,100
right
 

61
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,240
right
so first is if I gave you an answer if I

62
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,250
so first is if I gave you an answer if I
 

63
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,740
so first is if I gave you an answer if I
said the meaning of life is to please

64
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:00,750
said the meaning of life is to please
 

65
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,049
said the meaning of life is to please
God well which God okay judeo-christian

66
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:03,059
God well which God okay judeo-christian
 

67
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,939
God well which God okay judeo-christian
God well okay why that one why this

68
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:04,949
God well okay why that one why this
 

69
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,800
God well okay why that one why this
thing the problem is it's a why question

70
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:06,810
thing the problem is it's a why question
 

71
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,950
thing the problem is it's a why question
you can keep asking why forever right

72
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:09,960
you can keep asking why forever right
 

73
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,109
you can keep asking why forever right
any answer I give you you just ask why

74
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:12,119
any answer I give you you just ask why
 

75
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,450
any answer I give you you just ask why
again why again why good that's right

76
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:14,460
again why again why good that's right
 

77
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,090
again why again why good that's right
and you end up in a place called a grip

78
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,100
and you end up in a place called a grip

astre lemma
okay this is a philosophical exercise

82
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:20,280
okay this is a philosophical exercise
 

83
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,219
okay this is a philosophical exercise
but I kind of thought it through then

84
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:22,229
but I kind of thought it through then
 

85
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,420
but I kind of thought it through then
googled around and there's a thing

86
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:23,430
googled around and there's a thing
 

87
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,030
googled around and there's a thing
called a grip astre lemma and a grip was

94
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:32,939
places okay
 

95
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,780
places okay
first is infinite regress right why

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,640
first is infinite regress right why
because of this why that what and just

essentially right so there is no answer

00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,030
essentially right so there is no answer
 

133
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,500
essentially right so there is no answer
the real answer is because

the real answer is because

would not be free we would be trapped

142
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:23,220
would not be free we would be trapped
 

143
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,310
would not be free we would be trapped
because then we would all have to live

144
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,320
because then we would all have to live
 

145
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,050
because then we would all have to live
to that answer then we'd be Borg like

to that answer then we'd be Borg like
