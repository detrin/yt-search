1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,600
Everybody knows the secret.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,920
The secret is surrender.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,160
To really surrender to the unconditional state of life... of creation.

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,480
That is something to think about.

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,240
The whole of creation is just waiting for you to surrender...

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,400
realise that you are part of this all... that this is you.

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,400
You may leave it.  You may become estranged from it.

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,560
And alienated from it.

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,240
But it’ll always be there in the present

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,040
until you rediscover it.

11
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,680
That’s part of the wonderful mystery of creation.

12
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,880
Nothing happens in some past place or in some future place.

13
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,600
Everything happens exactly in the present.

14
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,320
I like my mental body to just remember to be here now.

15
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,280
That I am here now, in this.

16
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,400
If your attention is caught up in the world’s doings

17
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,840
then it drifts off the whole time.

18
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,080
Most of the time we are either in the past or in the future.

19
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,080
It’s just our mental bodies that distracts us

20
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,520
and alienates us from being here.

21
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,200
Well, I think I’ve experienced quite a lot of things

22
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,360
that man is prone to experience.

23
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,160
Being in public

24
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,800
and feeling the awareness of people and their projections,

25
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,360
there was a time in my life when these things disturbed me

26
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,920
and really put me off course.

27
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,880
The world consists of these stories that people tell each other.

28
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,720
These stories tend to pin you down.

29
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,840
And we pin each other down with our stories as well...

30
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,480
our judgements about others and our judgements about ourselves.

31
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,920
And a lot of it is unconscious.

32
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,120
It’s projections that you receive from the world around you,

33
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,360
building a reality which is not real at all... it’s totally illusionary.

34
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,880
It’s part of our mental ability to go on automatic

35
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,400
and to instil stories inside ourselves which will keep on reinforcing

36
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
certain negative perceptions.

37
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,520
You nurture this victimhood and you nurture this suffering

38
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,400
as though it belongs to you, as though you’ve identified with it.

39
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,720
If you can get out of that paradigm and realise that

40
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,040
you must take responsibility for everything that happens to you

41
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,120
because it’s meant for you.

42
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,880
Other people can’t help you.

43
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,360
You must take responsibility for your journey.

44
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,640
Where I am and what comes to me, I must deal with that.

45
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:15,000
Unconditionally... I must just deal with what life is bringing to me...

46
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,080
putting on my plate.

47
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,120
Everything that life deals you is a gift.

48
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,000
If the word ‘love’ has any meaning, that’s what it means...

49
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,240
it’s an unconditional surrendering to what is.

50
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,280
You must unconditionally accept everyone and everything as it is.

51
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,080
The moment love is conditioned, it is no longer love...

52
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,880
there are strings attached, there are agendas behind it.

53
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,320
So unconditional love is something that brings one to a standstill.

54
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,760
It means not being judgemental.

55
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,160
It means not reacting immediately to something

56
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,200
that you find unacceptable or uncomfortable at that moment.

57
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,360
But to look again.

58
00:06:50,640 --> 00:07:00,960
Love is that intangible constant of the eternal present.

59
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,680
I don’t know if you know the music of Dollar Brand?

60
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,520
He says...

61
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,800
‘Behold the night and day.’

62
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:39,840
‘Gently, gently, they give way to each other dear brother.’

63
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:48,960
‘I met him of the night, with his arms full of love light.’

64
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,880
I can’t recall the whole poem just at this very moment.

65
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:02,040
But it’s really beautiful... really something to listen to.

66
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,840
I’m grateful to be alive.

67
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,360
I think life is a marvellous gift.

68
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,280
And it’s a great paradox and a great mystery.

69
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,800
I just have these feelings of gratitude.

70
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,320
It’s part of realising that this is the gift of life.

71
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,560
And it all comes back to love, which is the foundation of creation.

72
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:03,000
The answer is to just be there unconditionally....

73
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,920
knowing that love is all there is.
