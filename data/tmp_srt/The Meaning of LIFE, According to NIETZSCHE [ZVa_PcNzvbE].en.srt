1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,040
quotes since I have come to know the body\h
better zarathustra said to one of his disciples\h\h

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:16,020
the spirit is to me only quasi-spirit and\h
all that is permanent is also a mere parable\h\h

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,320
I have heard you say that once before\h
the disciple replied and at that time\h\h

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,320
you added but the poets lie too much why\h
did you say that the poets lie too much\h\h

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,200
why said zarathustra you ask why I'm not one\h
of those whom one may ask about their why\h\h

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,060
is my experience but of yesterday it was long ago\h
that I experienced the reasons for my opinions\h\h

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,820
would I not have to be a barrel of memory if\h
I wanted to carry my reasons around with me\h\h

8
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,240
it is already too much for me to remember\h
my own opinions and many a bird flies away\h\h

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,680
and now and then I also find a stray in my dovecot\h
that is strange to me and trembles when I place\h\h

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,920
my hand on it but what was it that zarathustra\h
once said to you that the poets lie too much\h\h

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:19,020
but zarathustra II is a poet do you now believe\h
that he spoke truth here why do you believe that\h\h

12
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:27,960
the disciple answered I believe in zarathustra\h
but zarathustra shook his head and smiled\h\h

13
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,880
Faith does not make me blessed he said\h
especially not faith in me end quote\h\h

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:46,020
that's from zarathistra part 2 chapter 12 on poets\h
and uh while it's ostensibly about poets and their\h\h

15
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,860
trustworthiness I think that the scene contains\h
so much uh so many gems for helping us to sum up\h\h

16
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,060
the central thrust of Nietzsche's affirmative\h
philosophy his spiritual philosophy as I have\h\h

17
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:07,380
called it which is anti-spirit and we'll talk\h
briefly about what that means the idea of Geist\h\h

18
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,900
and German which contains both the concept of Mind\h
and Spirit or means something approximate to both\h\h

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,200
um that had been invoked in both a philosophical\h
and religious context and in spirit we have\h\h

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,520
something which is a conception of the immaterial\h
spirit is not subject to the laws of physics it\h\h

21
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,380
doesn't arise and pass away like matter it's\h
not something destructible from the time of the\h\h

22
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,380
ancient Greeks philosophers and Priests alike\h
have made reference to an indestructible being\h\h

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,480
either a primordial Unity from which we steal our\h
existence as in the concept of the indefinite the\h\h

24
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:53,340
aperon written of by anaximander or else The\h
fedantist View that all the world is of the\h\h

25
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,400
same substance as the Brahman the godhead\h
and that this entire reality occurs behind\h\h

26
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,820
a Veil of Maya which means illusion and\h
that therefore there exists in fact only\h\h

27
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,580
the one and our separateness from it is\h
simply our own ignorance our own delusion\h\h

28
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,100
and we can recognize the same thought about\h
being throughout the history of both eastern\h\h

29
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,880
and western philosophy since nothing seems to last\h
in physical reality then why not take the Buddhist\h\h

30
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,940
View at the end of the day that all phenomenon we\h
perceive in physical reality are basically empty\h\h

31
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,360
and that to the extent that anything exists\h
it only exists at best as a representation\h\h

32
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,940
it's only within our perception that definite\h
boundaries or a sense of duration can exist\h\h

33
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,160
now in the West in contrast to that Buddhist view\h
we have not been content to rest at that position\h\h

34
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,100
that things are all empty and impermanent\h
we've we've instead sought for that permanent\h\h

35
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:03,300
indestructible being and since the Advent of\h
Christendom or even of monotheism generally\h\h

36
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,580
this has always been associated\h
with God this uh permanence of being\h\h

37
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,260
and within ourselves we project\h
the same concept of being\h\h

38
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:20,160
our identity is secured in Christian thought\h
because we have an immortal soul which is created\h\h

39
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,000
in the image of that same permanent indestructible\h
being and remember God is a spirit in Christianity\h\h

40
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,060
um our souls are also spiritual and not\h
material and so that we've created this\h\h

41
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,160
whole spiritual realm in which there is\h
permanence in which there can be permanence\h\h

42
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:46,380
the physical form the body does not have the same\h
degree of reality as Spirit within the this type\h\h

43
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,860
of worldview because the body is impermanent we've\h
made permanence in this view the standard of being\h\h

44
00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:02,340
and therefore we now say Spirit alone is and thus\h
at the end of get as Faust and the final lines of\h\h

45
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:09,060
the play the chorus mysticus sings As Faust\h
descends to Heaven quote what is destructible\h\h

46
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:16,140
is but a parable what fails\h
ineluctably the undeclarable end quote\h\h

47
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,900
which means all that has happened in the past\h
no longer exists only what's happening in the\h\h

48
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,140
present is real all that exists within this world\h
of arising and passing away therefore is at best\h\h

49
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:37,800
only a parable because what's real is eternal\h
what has permanence is what has true substance\h\h

50
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,940
and so we might say you can kind of look at the\h
whole story of all these destructible things\h\h

51
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,300
this Narrative of uh you know whatever\h
it might be the classic hero cycle or\h\h

52
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,580
the story of your own life right but in the\h
end that story is the only thing that's real\h\h

53
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,480
um it's a very deep set of lines that has\h
contextual meaning specific to the fast play\h\h

54
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,480
insofar as the chorus is announcing that all the\h
things that were said and done in the course of\h\h

55
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:18,420
Faust's story form a parable um but in in that in\h
some sense that's those stories very clever way of\h\h

56
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:26,520
um of saying what can't be said that all\h
is fleeting and yet the story of all is\h\h

57
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:34,620
permanent that the archetype the ideal uh\h
exists timelessly and so the story of Our\h\h

58
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,060
Lives you know it isn't written until the end\h
when it becomes history that's when it attains\h\h

59
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,640
meaning just as Faust's story can't really be\h
understood until it is enclosed by the conclusion\h\h

60
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,480
and um you know the undertone of all this it's\h
clear as in the context of the story because it\h\h

61
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,480
takes place against the backdrop of Faust being\h
reborn into his new Immortal perfect body into\h\h

62
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,000
eternity Faust becomes being in the story\h
and uh so as in the chorus indicates this\h\h

63
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,940
is a mystery it can't fully be um encapsulated\h
into words that's why we have the story right\h\h

64
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,080
the meaning is Illustrated in the parable where\h
it was translated into action rather than words\h\h

65
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:21,120
um and so it's a very uh it's a very deep and\h
beautiful uh idea but the Fatal flaw as we've\h\h

66
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,800
discussed it uh literally the Fatal flaw as\h
we've discussed it throughout the podcast\h\h

67
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,980
is that by the time that definite ending\h
happens in our own lives our lives are over\h\h

68
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,960
it's a another way of restating Nietzsche's\h
criticism of the world of spirit that insofar\h\h

69
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,980
as it is a means of justifying life and making\h
a parable it promises Redemption only in death\h\h

70
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,020
and so zarathistra directly in these lines\h
rebukes the chorus mysticus at the beginning\h\h

71
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:03,000
at the beginning of the passage and he says on\h
the contrary that what is permanent is but a\h\h

72
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,560
parable that rather these assertions of something\h
which transcend the conditions of impermanence and\h\h

73
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,580
temporality that we see in the physical world only\h
exist in our minds uh mere abstractions spirit is\h\h

74
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,440
only quasi-spirit what he means by that remark\h
true enough Geist means mind and that Spirit\h\h

75
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:29,040
surely exists within this world of the mind\h
but as such an abstraction right right uh it's\h\h

76
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:35,100
uh nominally real but it's not physically real\h
and so that's the real essence of our being is\h\h

77
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:41,760
physical physiological and that it therefore our\h
being is subject to temporality and impermanence\h\h

78
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,420
um and then rather than believing in these\h
Parables of God or Brahman in order to imagine\h\h

79
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:55,020
that we can have something by which to Anchor\h
ourselves and our existence instead zarthustra\h\h

80
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:01,320
says he's come to understand the body better we\h
have to come to understand ourselves as bodies\h\h

81
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:10,920
that life is necessarily embodied it's physical\h
and um you know because it's necessarily embodied\h\h

82
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:20,460
it's individual and subjective it comes with this\h
certain perspective right um and by imagining on\h\h

83
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,980
the other side of that coin that the root of life\h
and its foundation is found in something spiritual\h\h

84
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,540
you know uh meaning abstract permanent\h
absolute that's what we mean by spiritual\h\h

85
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:43,500
uh by doing that we've harmed life we've Frozen it\h
um I know of a close friend who he's got sort of a\h\h

86
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,560
oh he describes him as a weird family member who\h
uh he says his hobby is to freeze and photograph\h\h

87
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,320
wasps I was like what apparently you can sort\h
of like uh freeze them I don't know what they\h\h

88
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:03,300
use but it like slows them down and then you can\h
basically take them and photograph them uh but\h\h

89
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:10,080
you know it's like that's uh that's what I think\h
that's a great mental image for what Nietzsche\h\h

90
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,420
might uh criticize all of our metaphysics of\h
spirit and what it does to our conception of life\h\h

91
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:26,940
um so zarthestra further down in the passage\h
uh he says quote all gods are poets Parables\h\h

92
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:34,620
poets prevarications verily it always lifts us\h
higher specifically to the realm of the clouds\h\h

93
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:42,600
upon these we place our Motley bastards\h
and call them gods and over men end quote\h\h

94
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:51,240
so he's it's funny because so he's we're talking\h
about the realm of the clouds of the obvious\h\h

95
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,760
philosophical referent you'd think would\h
be like Cloud Cuckoo Land um they're very\h\h

96
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:03,120
obvious implications about your head being in the\h
clouds and what zarthister employs to talk about\h\h

97
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:11,640
um or rather to invert the way we think about the\h
realm of spirit in relation to the physical as a\h\h

98
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,840
spirit giving rise to the physical or at least\h
the way people tended to think about it in his\h\h

99
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,840
own time of thinking instead implicitly in that\h
quote I just read of the physical being the thing\h\h

100
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,020
that gives rise to the spiritual that the abstract\h
the conceptual life has a physiological origin\h\h

101
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,820
and he employs not only the idea of God he also\h
uses his own idea of the over man or he's you know\h\h

102
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:42,240
we call them gods and over men it's not obviously\h
Nietzsche's own idea of the over man but um he's\h\h

103
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,500
established the concept of the over man throughout\h
the text as his you know new uh ideal for mankind\h\h

104
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,280
that is beyond Christianity that is uh in line\h
with the sort of dionysian view of humanity and\h\h

105
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:05,460
what life is and but here he recognizes\h
um all these ideals are stories and fibs\h\h

106
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:13,980
and in all ideals what actually happens is that\h
those of us here and now who are depending on\h\h

107
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,380
what terms you want to use and how religious\h
your own interpretations of Human Action are uh\h\h

108
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:26,100
might be you know we're all variously Unholy and\h
Wayward and lustful and murderous and vindictive\h\h

109
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,700
you know all these things you could say about\h
the human race and then we're the ones who come\h\h

110
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,200
up with the image of what Holiness looks\h
like you know us modern day people who are\h\h

111
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,560
um imperfect and selfish and with are cobbled\h
together Cosmopolitan moralities and religious\h\h

112
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:48,000
beliefs and then we presume to say what the over\h
man would look like when we do that we inevitably\h\h

113
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,500
construct such an image out of our own values\h
and our own virtues or lack thereof and so how\h\h

114
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,120
will those of us who are sick and have always\h
been sick produce an image of what is healthy\h\h

115
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:08,280
now going back to earlier in the dialogue um\h
the response from the disciple when he hears\h\h

116
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,440
zarathustra say that permanence is but a parable\h
so you remember zarathus for saying this before\h\h

117
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,620
but before he remembers zarathustra included\h
but the poets lie too much as a sort of caveat\h\h

118
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,960
but zarathustra's answer to this\h
is to clarify that he's also a poet\h\h

119
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,340
and that he can't therefore be trusted\h
in saying that the poets lie too much\h\h

120
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:37,140
um and the reason why he would say poets lie too\h
much um you know so it's funny because that's\h\h

121
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:46,380
sort of a it's a self-referential self-destroying\h
statement right but throughout Nietzsche's work\h\h

122
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,200
um what he has to say about\h
artists are the artistic process

123
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:01,500
um he says there's an essential incompleteness\h
to Art and an essential will to deception that\h\h

124
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,380
exists in art um and many authors throughout\h
the years have levied charges like this\h\h

125
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,320
but uh Nietzsche on the other hand\h
includes himself in the lot of the\h\h

126
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:21,240
accused and and he struggles over it uh\h
sometimes especially in his poetry and so\h\h

127
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:27,720
when zarath Esther says The Poets lie too much\h
he also must include himself amongst the poets\h\h

128
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:36,420
and so what is the caveat to zarathustra's\h
refutation of impermanence here and his rebuttal\h\h

129
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:42,480
to Gerta why does zarathustra take care to remind\h
us that he lies too much when he when he gives\h\h

130
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,560
us this rebuttal and perhaps it is because this\h
view of life that zarath Esther presents is also\h\h

131
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:58,260
a poetic gloss on reality that would be a surface\h
level reading that life is becoming is another lie\h\h

132
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:06,780
in other places which we'll look at today\h
describes life in terms of Will To Power\h\h

133
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,100
which is apparently a consistent enduring\h
principle wouldn't that be a kind of permanence\h\h

134
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,360
or perhaps we could consider the eternalization\h
of Our Lives within the con text of the\h\h

135
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,240
Eternal recurrence which would mean if we\h
take it seriously that everything physical\h\h

136
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:36,060
is actually permanent right it's permanent in its\h
sort of fluid ever Dynamic state right but the\h\h

137
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,800
parable of your life the story of your life always\h
plays out the same way in like the superposition\h\h

138
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:48,240
is the same we might say and so the whole idea\h
of permanence as but a parable would itself be\h\h

139
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,520
incorrect it would be zerothistra\h
would be the lying poet in saying that\h\h

140
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,160
uh from that perspective if we take the eternal\h
return very literally and so there are endless\h\h

141
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:05,280
ways to interpret this and rather than give us\h
a canonical interpretation sarathastra instead\h\h

142
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:11,160
seemingly goes off in a non-sequitur from the\h
main point which ends up being the topic of\h\h

143
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,020
the chapter I mean when asked to explain himself\h
he explains why he can't really explain himself\h\h

144
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,080
and so we started out talking about life as\h
an embodied existence not the permanence of\h\h

145
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,860
spirit but now the passage is about\h
sarath ester's own untrustworthiness\h\h

146
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,840
and I think it's digressions like these and\h
thus books are a Thruster that can throw off\h\h

147
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:37,080
some readers but is it a non-sequitur I mean is\h
there some connecting tissue for this passage\h\h

148
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,840
on closer examinations earthhsters explain\h
explanation that he gives of why he can't\h\h

149
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:49,680
be trusted is because his thoughts the abstract\h
Productions of his intellect are merely memories\h\h

150
00:16:50,520 --> 00:17:01,680
the experiences of yesterday to zarathustra who he\h
is is the body and its impulses which is it's not\h\h

151
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:09,060
dependent on memory in any sense most of the self\h
is subconscious it strings the conscious intellect\h\h

152
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:15,720
along our thoughts are like a superficial surface\h
and skin a conscious gloss on reality the reality\h\h

153
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,560
that's first and foremost physical and driven by\h
physical need physical desire physical instincts\h\h

154
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:28,680
and this even applies to our philosophizing as\h
Nietzsche argues and Beyond Good and Evil that the\h\h

155
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:35,700
philosopher is merely giving a voice to whoever\h
whatever um has he put it moral or immoral aims\h\h

156
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,000
are deep within him uh he says the philosopher\h
is giving a confession he's telling us who he\h\h

157
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,980
is revealing his deepest instincts of thought and\h
so zarathustra Compares his own thoughts to birds\h\h

158
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,900
his conscious mind is just like a little Roost\h
for a bunch of thoughtbirds to come and make\h\h

159
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,900
their nests and some of which are not even his\h
you know he says that sometimes he finds foreign\h\h

160
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,400
thoughts in his mind that have flown in from\h
somewhere else and they don't really belong to him\h\h

161
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:12,480
they tremble as he places his hand on them\h
so carrying around his reasons for things he\h\h

162
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,380
said and did is something zarathustra dismisses\h
because our conscious reasons for doing things\h\h

163
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:25,200
are not themselves the truth he doesn't\h
want to become a barrel full of reasons\h\h

164
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:36,180
because reasons bring us no closer to that\h
that raw physical truth and thus we might\h\h

165
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:42,780
recall Nietzsche's statement in Daybreak that the\h
Consciousness is a commentary on an unknown text\h\h

166
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:51,540
and what Nietzsche has done here in this new\h
conception of the body is that he's given us\h\h

167
00:18:51,540 --> 00:19:00,360
a holy mystery throughout his work he attempts\h
to Humble the conscious mind before the body\h\h

168
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:11,460
humble reason before the importance of passion\h
and thus the ultimate spiritualization of the body\h\h

169
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,300
is to make the physical body akin to\h
the way that we have conceived of spirit\h\h

170
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:26,280
in such a way as to give power to Spirit and\h
our conception of it and so in Nietzsche's\h\h

171
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:33,840
philosophy the body is the Lord issuing\h
Commandments to the conscious mind\h\h

172
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:43,200
you know that's your the conscious mind uh\h
in its relationship to the body uh you know\h\h

173
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,240
the people who have difficulties in Life or\h
fail failings of the will we might compare\h\h

174
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:57,660
them to a uh a defiant Center who's you know\h
ego Consciousness is compelling him to defy\h\h

175
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:06,120
the uh dictates the natural order of the issue\h
from his Lord which is should be his body right\h\h

176
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:14,040
and the body is a mystery to us just as no\h
one knows the mind of God none of us may know\h\h

177
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,380
the true nature of our own inner life where the\h
deepest drives and impulses within us come from\h\h

178
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:28,380
Nietzsche insists on unconscious origins of all\h
our motives and even our philosophical ideas\h\h

179
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:37,260
and so our attempt to have control over the world\h
through our own self-conscious rationality has to\h\h

180
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:46,440
yield to a love of fate and in this formulation\h
uh I think it's important I did not say faith\h\h

181
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:54,780
uh even though I could see one reaching for such a\h
term but the reason I didn't is because Nietzsche\h\h

182
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:01,080
has this perhaps unusual way of presenting\h
his ideas which may be relatively rare within\h\h

183
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,940
philosophy he tells us that we shouldn't really\h
believe him and that sarathustra is not a reliable\h\h

184
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:12,120
source and that therefore it's not appropriate for\h
you to follow Nietzsche who is only human All Too\h\h

185
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:21,000
Human and that having faith in his religion is not\h
a Sacrament but a kind of sin assuming that I mean\h\h

186
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,800
we even permit the idea of sin but I mean have\h
you ever heard of religion like that you know a\h\h

187
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,240
lot of religions will claim the specific point\h
of their uniqueness right hear it all the time\h\h

188
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,420
um you know I've heard uh Christians say the\h
uniqueness of their religion is that their God\h\h

189
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:43,800
lives in lived and died in human form right became\h
he he lived the through the suffering and the uh\h\h

190
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:52,920
the mortality that we all live with right um so\h
what's the uniqueness in Nietzsche's religion\h\h

191
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:01,320
I I would say faith which is so fundamental to\h
every religious tradition that the word faith\h\h

192
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,660
is itself a synonym for a religious tradition in\h
the sense we talk about people of many different\h\h

193
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:14,400
faiths right but Nietzsche uh or zarathustra\h
rejects faith and it would even be hard to\h\h

194
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,620
call that a sin the way I did earlier um I mean\h
every religion tends to have a concept of sin to\h\h

195
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:25,560
whatever they might call it but sarthustra's\h
reaction to someone's misplaced faith in him\h\h

196
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:32,400
is not chastisement or even forgiveness\h
but uh just he laughs and shakes his head\h\h

197
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,500
you know the way a parent might laugh at\h
their child you know it's like a making a\h\h

198
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,520
simple innocent mistake or something like that\h
it's not it's a good-hearted laugh it's not\h\h

199
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:50,760
um at least that's the read I get off the passage\h
so just to put what we're talking about in context\h\h

200
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,940
here we're coming to the end of the season of\h
the podcast and I want to to give a summary of\h\h

201
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:04,920
Nietzsche's revaluation and particularly his\h
affirmative philosophy as we have explored it\h\h

202
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:13,020
which means describing this new form of\h
spirituality or anti-spirituality and\h\h

203
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:18,600
saying what it means in Practical terms\h
to begin following the value of life\h\h

204
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,920
and furthermore to hopefully give a sort\h
of synthesis to all the major ideas we've\h\h

205
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:32,940
covered this season the over man the\h
eternal return Will To Power Amor Fati\h\h

206
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,640
what does life look like to us when all these\h
philosophical pieces are fitted into place and\h\h

207
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:46,200
when life is understood from this New Foundation\h
of um you know the body as the root of it all\h\h

208
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:54,420
and nevertheless in that affirmative philosophy\h
we have to do this with an awareness of this\h\h

209
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:00,060
particular tendency in Nietzsche that to tell us\h
not to follow him and to find our own way and to\h\h

210
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:07,200
remember that he could be lying to us and that in\h
fact The Poets always lie so we must include this\h\h

211
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,840
element within the summary of what the meaning\h
of life is for Nietzsche because this affects\h\h

212
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,420
how we might integrate Nietzsche into our life\h
because the answer cannot be well now we have this\h\h

213
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,700
blueprint these do-it-yourself instructions step\h
one step two step three for how to become what\h\h

214
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:31,020
one is right none of these Concepts or figures\h
such as the Overman or the spirit of gravity\h\h

215
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:41,160
have any more actual reality to them than God or\h
the devil did right and ultimately there can never\h\h

216
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:50,400
be an orthodox presentation of the nietzschean\h
message now I believe that one can in spite of\h\h

217
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,480
that create a coherent and accurate presentation\h
of nietzschean affirmative philosophy and that\h\h

218
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,980
we can say definitively what it is Nietzsche\h
asserted what he criticized what he admired\h\h

219
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:08,700
what he rejected as evidenced by what he writes\h
in his own books the postmodern position is\h\h

220
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,500
really not my own like I think there are more\h
accurate interpretations of nature than others\h\h

221
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,220
um even though all interpretations are physic are\h
are uh fictional excuse me uh quite the opposite\h\h

222
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,680
of physical you know I and I think I can hold both\h
of those propositions and I would say to Nietzsche\h\h

223
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:31,920
himself who sometimes wrote Things implying that\h
the interpretation of a work is all there is\h\h

224
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,820
that nature is indeed correct that the poets\h
like Nietzsche lie too much and I don't believe\h\h

225
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:45,540
him on that particular point um but when we\h
go beyond the philosophical or theoretical\h\h

226
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:52,920
and into the Practical into the specifics um\h
zarthostress preachments not to follow him\h\h

227
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:59,460
and to discover your own path become very very\h
relevant and there's some sense in which any\h\h

228
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:05,160
useful life advice will always be contextual\h
and relative any code of virtue or behavior\h\h

229
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,140
when extended to be completely General will simply\h
become another form of universal morality of an\h\h

230
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,700
ought imposed on existence and\h
therefore a judgment passed on existence\h\h

231
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:26,160
and so Niche and life philosophy always\h
must avoid this and so these limitations\h\h

232
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:33,180
they don't make the challenge of describing\h
Nietzsche's affirmative philosophy impossible I\h\h

233
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,940
mean quite the contrary they set the boundaries\h
of what such a thing might look like and so we\h\h

234
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,680
have to we have to refine the question and ask is\h
there any way to do this without falling victim\h\h

235
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,820
to dogmatism or to violating the\h
spirit of Nietzsche's philosophy\h\h

236
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:56,940
and it's a pressing question to me because\h
it's demanded uh that we derive some\h\h

237
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,260
practical application in order to say that\h
Nietzsche's philosophy has mattered at all\h\h

238
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:09,120
and in order to integrate his philosophy into\h
our lives um and so what is his answer to the\h\h

239
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,700
life problem if we can't make that answer real\h
in our own lives then is it really an answer\h\h

240
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,060
and so it's a bit of a different question\h
than we normally ask on the podcast\h\h

241
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:30,060
and I I should say um what we normally do on this\h
podcast is philology really I mean there's some\h\h

242
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:35,580
philosophizing and involved but mostly what\h
I'm doing here is less akin to what Nietzsche\h\h

243
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,260
did when he was writing his books up in sales\h
Maria and more like what Nietzsche was doing\h\h

244
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:47,640
when he was studying the Greek philosophers of\h
Basel although probably nowhere near the skill\h\h

245
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,440
level of either Nietzsche but uh you know it's\h
philology we're studying the history of ideas

246
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,600
um and so but I I don't want to just try and\h
catalog Nietzsche's ideas and the ideas of his\h\h

247
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:07,500
influences I want to sincerely engage with figures\h
from the past I want to learn what it is that they\h\h

248
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,660
thought and felt and I want to know the context\h
of their lives as a background for their thought\h\h

249
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:20,640
and I don't want to do this in order to judge them\h
or affix a label either moral or a qualitative\h\h

250
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,140
judgment I mean sometimes that still happens\h
because we're human we judge all the time\h\h

251
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:33,000
uh and so you know that's man is the measure of\h
all things right that's what it means to be a\h\h

252
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,120
mensch in German the etymological root suggests\h
man is a measurer so naturally we make judgments\h\h

253
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,920
and oftentimes we feel it's our prerogative to\h
judge philosophers and other figures from history\h\h

254
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:52,260
as to whether their ideas are worthy of\h
us or sometimes what we want to do is take\h\h

255
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:57,420
our own ideas from today and simply project\h
them onto past figures in order to to claim\h\h

256
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,460
someone you know Jesus was a socialist or\h
Jesus was a Libertarian that sort of thing

257
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,280
um but here I think we can learn a great\h
deal from Nietzsche's own example of how\h\h

258
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,760
he treated the Greek philosophers\h
when he himself was a philologist\h\h

259
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:19,440
and a sincere practice of philologians involves\h
a sort of oath not to project yourself under past\h\h

260
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,860
figures and not to judge past figures relative\h
to your time or interpret them anachronistically\h\h

261
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:32,580
um or you know judge them in accord with events\h
that haven't happened yet or standards they didn't\h\h

262
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:39,180
hold or facts they didn't know about to really get\h
to know someone and get into their head it's not\h\h

263
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:45,000
when you try to figure out what you yourself think\h
of of a figure from history like be it Nietzsche\h\h

264
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,740
or heraclitus or Emerson schopenhauer or geta\h
or Plato but instead when we try to figure out\h\h

265
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:01,200
what would all of those people think of me and I\h
think that's how you really enter into a dialogue\h\h

266
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,780
with artists and thinkers from history um because\h
we're always going to put our own judgment on them\h\h

267
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,120
so what you really need is two-way communication\h
right so figure out what they would be telling you\h\h

268
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,840
about your life and then you can pass your\h
judgments and have your assessment anyway\h\h

269
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,160
I feel we we've done that with\h
Nietzsche throughout this podcast\h\h

270
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:27,660
uh but as we've already considered Nietzsche\h
is so aware of this danger of dogmatism\h\h

271
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:33,660
being attached to his own ideas that he can't\h
present it as specific Universal moral advice\h\h

272
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:39,120
as I've said we're going to try and infer\h
some general principles from his statements\h\h

273
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,700
but in the final analysis Nietzsche presents\h
his ideas in such a way that there is no\h\h

274
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:50,640
Universal Doctrine or way of life and it's not\h
just because Nietzsche doesn't want disciples\h\h

275
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:57,120
but because he would argue there is no Universal\h
way of life for human beings and that all of us\h\h

276
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,760
in the end must find our own way whether you\h
want to believe that that's something you have\h\h

277
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,200
to do or not it's simply the reality and what's\h
good for one person it's not necessarily good\h\h

278
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,000
for another and we all have our lies and fables\h
within our conscious gloss of thought which may be\h\h

279
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,300
appropriate for us but not for others so everyone\h
has to become what he or she is on their own terms\h\h

280
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,780
um and people are always looking to abdicate\h
our own authority and our own responsibility\h\h

281
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,640
for our will and defer to some Authority which\h
is beyond ourselves and Nietzsche quite simply\h\h

282
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,900
will not let us do that with him and his ideas and\h
that's the last thing he wants rather he wants to\h\h

283
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,840
put you in a position such that your will and the\h
nature of your own character and instincts can\h\h

284
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:50,340
be made clearer to yourself such that you're in a\h
better position to realize your greatest potential\h\h

285
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,620
um and there doesn't need to be free will in\h
this process it's simply a fact that with more\h\h

286
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:01,440
awareness of yourself you gain more knowledge\h
uh you gain relevant knowledge over your own\h\h

287
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,500
life and never has the acquisition of\h
new knowledge limited one's options\h\h

288
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,360
it may reveal to you that an option you\h
thought you had didn't really exist but\h\h

289
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,600
that doesn't really take anything away since it\h
was never really there to begin with so that it's\h\h

290
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,000
an increase in one's power right uh we might\h
say since limiting out the options that would\h\h

291
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,760
bring harm to yourself is not a decrease in your\h
power and we fully think that proposition through\h\h

292
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:36,420
and so an honest awareness of ourselves and our\h
own nature because of the mystery of our own\h\h

293
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:44,100
subconscious and instinctual life it can very\h
well be a lifelong quest for self-knowledge\h\h

294
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,520
this isn't something you know you might think okay\h
I'm gonna make the nature of myself and my drives\h\h

295
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,320
clearer to myself how do I do that what's the\h
three-step process right it's a lifelong process\h\h

296
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,700
and since we've all started it we have\h
to carry it through to the end now\h\h

297
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,900
Nietzsche writes in the preface to genealogy of\h
morality quote we are strangers to ourselves we\h\h

298
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:12,960
men of knowledge end quote the the knowledge\h
of ourselves the thing we find farthest away\h\h

299
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,000
especially those of us who like to think\h
in these explicit abstract conceptual ways\h\h

300
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,180
this world of thought this world of the mind\h
of Geist it's the farthest thing away from the\h\h

301
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,320
physical reality of the body though and the\h
Deep impulses that really drive us because\h\h

302
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:37,440
the intellect the imagination has become so\h
free as to become increasingly untethered in\h\h

303
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:44,040
its Productions from any physical limitations\h
and the more objective and Abstract we\h\h

304
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:49,320
become in our thought the less we're able to\h
intuitively understand ourselves as subjects

305
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,100
um and so that is the great quandary\h
set before us men of knowledge\h\h

306
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:03,540
um in any case it's not possible as I've said\h
to give a canonical view of the nietzschean\h\h

307
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:10,680
life right or a canonical set of nietzschean\h
Virtues or a definitive vision of what the\h\h

308
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:16,080
Overman would be like um I think it is\h
on the other hand quite possible to say\h\h

309
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:23,580
in general terms what Nietzsche thinks\h
life is and what he thinks the good life is\h\h

310
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,380
we could address ourselves to that way of\h
looking at the question of the meaning of life\h\h

311
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:37,260
um and so actually I mean we really could break\h
down this most frequently Asked of existential\h\h

312
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:43,440
questions into its constituent parts and answer\h
the question as Nietzsche or zerathustra might\h\h

313
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,800
answer it answer each question and keeping in mind\h
that this is more of an art than a science here\h\h

314
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:57,420
as we kind of go over how I think each of these\h
questions might be answered but here are four\h\h

315
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,980
aspects actually that I think will cover most of\h
what people are asking about when they inquire\h\h

316
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:10,260
about the so-called meaning of life so first one\h
may ask what is life second what is the good life\h\h

317
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:18,840
Third how to facilitate the good life\h
and finally how to confront death

318
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,940
so let us address ourselves to the first question\h\h

319
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,100
I'll give the nietzschian foundation\h
for answering it what is life\h\h

320
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:36,780
we approach that question with resistance to\h
metaphysics that is to say a repudiation of the\h\h

321
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,940
traditional belief that we must begin with a set\h
of first principles or employ our reason in order\h\h

322
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:48,840
to transcend the limitations of our senses instead\h
we start from the immediate sense perception\h\h

323
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,400
that doesn't mean we're dogmatic about what it is\h
these senses indicate or what the quote unquote\h\h

324
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,460
true nature of the world really is it's simply\h
that those questions must be tabled because\h\h

325
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:08,280
this true world so long as it's conceived of\h
is this mind independent reality a reality\h\h

326
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,680
which exists in some objective form outside of\h
and independent of any human perception of it\h\h

327
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:23,880
has been recognized to be a useless concept it's a\h
misleading bypass instead we simply take the world\h\h

328
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:32,700
as revealed to us by the senses as the real world\h
good enough secondly when we apply our reason we\h\h

329
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,260
see that the world behaves according to patterns\h
and laws which can be apprehended by the senses\h\h

330
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,480
and this doesn't mean that these patterns\h
are Universal or mind independent\h\h

331
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:49,140
because we've done away with those Notions already\h
as a sort of first principle see I just said it so\h\h

332
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:54,960
I'm like laying out first principles and the first\h
principle is to do away with first principles\h\h

333
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,320
all right moving on the second principle you\h
see how it's like uh it almost impossible to\h\h

334
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,480
um I talk about this in a coherent way but I\h
think what he's saying still makes sense actually\h\h

335
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:13,380
um so really the what we're getting at\h
here is that it seems the behavior of\h\h

336
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,000
matter can be explained via the properties\h
of matter that we don't we don't find an\h\h

337
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,260
indication of some power beyond the world\h
without which the world can't be explained\h\h

338
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:28,200
rather we perceive that the power which is\h
driving the world is within the world itself\h\h

339
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:34,560
in past ages figures such as Spinoza believe\h
that there was an imminent quality of the\h\h

340
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:41,160
Divine in all things which animated the\h
world and this notion was carried on to\h\h

341
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,500
like some of the most important scientific figures\h
such as Newton who believed that motion had to\h\h

342
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:52,740
be explained by an appeal to God and we find\h
when we look back in western civilization all\h\h

343
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:59,700
the way to the time of the pre-platonics we have\h
empedocles who posits a first cause which started\h\h

344
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:06,480
all the processes we perceive in reality with\h
the atheistic schopenhauer Nietzsche found the\h\h

345
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,540
ingredient he needed to overcome this equality\h
within the world within life within the things\h\h

346
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:18,780
of existence which is not itself created by\h
something outside the world schopenhauer's\h\h

347
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,760
system was atheistic and yet he believed that\h
the world and the most fundamental level was Will\h\h

348
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,180
and when we look inward in schopenhauer's writing\h
he says you look inward you get in touch with the\h\h

349
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:35,340
deepest reality of our being we perceive that what\h
we are as will then that's the inner intelligible\h\h

350
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:41,340
character of Life the will for schopenhauer is in\h
all things all phenomena are a manifestation of it\h\h

351
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:46,380
it's completely undivided and only appears to be\h
that way to to be divided in all these different\h\h

352
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,420
forms due to our representations of it but it's\h
uh what does he say it's not increased when new\h\h

353
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,720
things are born or decreased when something dies\h
it exists equally in all things and it always has\h\h

354
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:03,720
been and always will be because it's not subject\h
to time time is simply another representation\h\h

355
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,940
uh when individuals arise the will doesn't\h
increase they pass away it doesn't diminish\h\h

356
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:15,840
that's show up an hour's View and so Nietzsche\h
was materialistic insofar as he believes that\h\h

357
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:21,180
the world's Behavior the motion of it you know\h
the world the patterns the laws we discussed\h\h

358
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:27,780
are not explained by anything outside of the\h
world and yet like schopenhauer Nietzsche\h\h

359
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:35,460
believes there is an inner content to phenomena\h
an intelligible character to them he also calls\h\h

360
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:41,280
it will but while schopenhauer believed that\h
the fundamental form of the will was ontological\h\h

361
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,760
meaning it's a true character of being which\h
exists independently of the world of phenomena\h\h

362
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:54,960
um and furthermore schopenhauer believes it\h
manifests as self-preservation because it's a will\h\h

363
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:02,640
towards continued existence and towards duration\h
Nietzsche believes instead in a boscovitchian\h\h

364
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:10,320
world which is a world of Multiplicity and the\h
basis of all those Wills is the will to power\h\h

365
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:18,540
what this means is not a will to duration\h
but a will to expand to conquer to dominate\h\h

366
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:24,540
to make itself felt to make its impact felt\h
to overcome and to create Beyond oneself\h\h

367
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,180
we might say to attempt to give rise to\h
something better for whatever that might mean\h\h

368
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:39,060
in perhaps not the same ontological sense of\h
schopenhauer Nietzsche nevertheless thinks that\h\h

369
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:44,280
these various drives are all really the same thing\h
that they we might say a better way to put it as\h\h

370
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:52,800
they can all be explained by the same principle of\h
Will To Power and he does at certain times even go\h\h

371
00:40:52,800 --> 00:41:00,360
as far to ask us to sort of dare to undertake the\h
thought experiment of considering that in terms of\h\h

372
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,680
our subjective experience the only intelligible\h
character of the world is Will To Power\h\h

373
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,600
now if this is the world's inner character it's\h
intelligible in her character Will To Power\h\h

374
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,480
some of us might immediately recognize that\h
there's at least an apparent contradiction\h\h

375
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,000
how can Nietzsche reject metaphysics but\h
posit a true character of the world which\h\h

376
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
is beyond the senses in some sense right\h
when we look around do we see Will To Power\h\h

377
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,200
with the senses and if not wouldn't it be an\h
abstract thing but Nietzsche believes there\h\h

378
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,880
is an observable basis to Will To Power\h
which we can perceive with our senses\h\h

379
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:50,460
and like heraclitus he would say that wilted\h
power is not an ontological reality behind\h\h

380
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:57,120
things but something which is revealed in the\h
behavior of all the things that we perceive\h\h

381
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:06,180
um and so you know for example on the level\h
of physics Will To Power as boscovich's\h\h

382
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:12,360
unified field Theory a single equation which\h
describes how every Force every pattern every\h\h

383
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:18,660
law in reality as we perceive them manifests\h
according to the distance at which it acts\h\h

384
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:24,660
all things are Force points that push and strive\h
for and against one another and he explains both\h\h

385
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:31,080
attraction and repulsion with the same equation\h
on the level of biology Will To Power is not\h\h

386
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:37,200
so much a drive for preservation as we've said\h
but the drives for nourishment and procreation\h\h

387
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:45,660
Nietzsche argues that nature is a great squanderer\h
that it can be wasteful arbitrary and so on the\h\h

388
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,740
individual of the species is never preserved I\h
mean quite the opposite really none of them are\h\h

389
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:58,740
preserved but the species survives if nourishment\h
and reproduction continue and so that is the uh\h\h

390
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:04,260
that is the pattern that we perceive right that's\h
the the parable right and so this is a drive to\h\h

391
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:09,060
exist yes but part of Nietzsche's point is that\h
it's not really descriptive to say that something\h\h

392
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:16,440
merely strives to exist because um that that\h
doesn't explain adamant matter at all of life why\h\h

393
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:23,040
we engage in action or motion uh it's a criticism\h
he levels at schopenhauer that we already exist\h\h

394
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,220
now and if the will driving life is simply a will\h
for us to continue existing then we're driven to\h\h

395
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:35,100
do a thing we're already doing we're striving to\h
attain something we already have um it doesn't\h\h

396
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:41,640
tell us anything about the actual character of\h
existence creates this strange Circle that things\h\h

397
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,940
exist for the sake of continuing to exist so why\h
then would life generate itself generate new forms\h\h

398
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:54,300
why would forms arise that move themselves\h
about and consume things and make offspring\h\h

399
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:02,160
Nietzsche's counter description is that life\h
is engaged in this process of striving to\h\h

400
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:08,520
find nourishment which means consume and extract\h
energy from other forms within the ecosystem and\h\h

401
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:14,580
to reproduce the process by which the organism\h
creates Beyond itself he says that organisms\h\h

402
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:21,180
don't seek to preserve themselves but to discharge\h
their strength that life is a positive phenomenon\h\h

403
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:29,400
not positive in the sense of good necessarily but\h
essentially generating self-generating doing so by\h\h

404
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:36,840
giving rise to things in a long active process\h
of differentiation as all things strive to be\h\h

405
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,640
different to be distinctive to express power in\h
their own particular way and thus Nietzsche would\h\h

406
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:48,600
say in our understanding of genetic mutation for\h
example and its role in evolution on the macro\h\h

407
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:54,540
scale you know the process of speciation we have\h
a phenomenon that's described by Will To Power\h\h

408
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,520
on the level of human\h
psychology or human sociality\h\h

409
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,800
Will To Power is an explanatory\h
principle for Human Action also\h\h

410
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:12,180
I mean in one sense power or potency is a\h
prerequisite for acting at all and in terms\h\h

411
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:19,800
of examining human motivations we find the desire\h
to become powerful and to feel powerful and to\h\h

412
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,260
manifest power at the root of all of them\h
Nietzsche argues for example that there's\h\h

413
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,360
no truly selfless act because all selfless\h
acts emerge from a foundation of selfishness\h\h

414
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:38,520
in fact selfishness and selflessness are not\h
opposites at all but gradations of the same thing\h\h

415
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:46,860
that our motivations can be coarse or refined\h
such that both the philanthropist and the car\h\h

416
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:53,460
thief are both expressing their Will To Power\h
or to put it another way our identity can be\h\h

417
00:45:53,460 --> 00:46:01,800
complex and individual or rigid and inherited\h
like the difference between us Children of the\h\h

418
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:10,020
age you know of uh of authenticity of discovering\h
our true selves um and someone placed in into a\h\h

419
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:18,480
role in Chinese Society by which he gains his\h
identity by family and class um and so we can\h\h

420
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:27,000
see how in various circumstances or different\h
cultural contexts different types of motivations\h\h

421
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,780
or different types of identities or means of\h
gaining one could be your means of advancing\h\h

422
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:41,160
um but they all we see a Will To Power as\h
a fundamental principle in all of these\h\h

423
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,560
and finally uh I mean just on the\h
moral level or The Meta moral level\h\h

424
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,900
Nietzsche argues all moralities that have\h
ever been created involve an element of self\h\h

425
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:58,080
overcoming shy of the basist Hedonism in which\h
one abandons discipline and restraint altogether\h\h

426
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,480
and lives purely according to one's impulses\h
any system of right and wrong requires that\h\h

427
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:10,620
one overcomes impulses instincts feelings either\h
abstaining altogether withholding from indulging\h\h

428
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:16,080
or doing so only in like a proper context\h
all morality is the attempt for the self to\h\h

429
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:22,020
challenge itself to challenge its own weaknesses\h
and shortcomings and become something greater\h\h

430
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:32,580
and so all of these are aspects of human life\h
and what life is is Will To Power from every\h\h

431
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:37,020
single one of those perspectives for Nietzsche\h
as something that he sees revealed empirically\h\h

432
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:45,720
in the world and it's it will to power is the\h
intelligible content which is generalizable\h\h

433
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:51,420
across all of these perspectives and Nietzsche\h
believes this again not because it's something we\h\h

434
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:57,300
find when we look deep within ourselves which is\h
what Mike schopenhauer's means trying to get over\h\h

435
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:06,060
the uh phenomena numina chasm uh you know although\h
I would argue that Nietzsche probably does believe\h\h

436
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:10,680
that if we did that honestly we would discover\h
will to power but that's not his reasoning for\h\h

437
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:16,500
for seeing it everywhere in the world right but\h
it's because it's manifest in all these observable\h\h

438
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:24,240
um phenomena and thus whatever the world might be\h
independent of the human mind we can say without\h\h

439
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:31,500
a doubt that the world for us the world as we\h
experience it is Will To Power Will To Power\h\h

440
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:37,200
is the simplest most fundamental statement\h
of what the world is like without an appeal\h\h

441
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,600
to anything outside of it being necessary\h
and without invoking a Divine personality\h\h

442
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:49,800
or an intelligence or purpose to life this\h
view life has no Transcendent value that is\h\h

443
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:56,520
to say a value imposed upon it from a world\h
that is above it and it has no purpose nature\h\h

444
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:03,000
says unless the circuit of Eternal recurrence\h
itself is a purpose and it has no intelligence\h\h

445
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:10,080
except insofar as we're a part of it and we're\h
intelligent but it seems that our intelligence\h\h

446
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:17,400
comes out of a blind unintelligent World in which\h
intelligence is not the rule but the exception\h\h

447
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:26,220
so now we'll look at a couple of Nietzsche\h
passages on life uh the first is his rebuke\h\h

448
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:33,480
to the stoics stoicism represents an attempt to\h
master one's passions so that one's not carried\h\h

449
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,680
away by their emotions and one doesn't\h
attach to one's current circumstances\h\h

450
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,800
um you know a common practice might be to\h
visualize what tragedies can and will befall you\h\h

451
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:52,680
um and so the stoic lives in the knowledge of\h
nature of what nature is really like all its\h\h

452
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,780
forms are fleeting and impermanent including\h
us and this is all uh just to give context I'm\h\h

453
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:03,000
not really reading this because of Nietzsche's\h
attack on the stoics but rather because of what\h\h

454
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:10,500
he says about life and nature in this section and\h
so this is section 9 of Beyond Good and Evil quote\h\h

455
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:20,160
according to Nature you want to live oh you Noble\h
stoics what deceptive words these are imagine\h\h

456
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,880
a being like nature wasteful beyond measure\h
indifferent beyond measure without purposes and\h\h

457
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,300
consideration without mercy and Justice fertile\h
and desolate and uncertain at the same time\h\h

458
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:41,640
imagine indifference itself as a power how\h
could you live according to this indifference\h\h

459
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:49,140
is that not precisely wanting to be other\h
than this nature is not living estimating\h\h

460
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:56,520
preferring being unjust being limited\h
wanting to be different and supposing\h\h

461
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:03,840
you're imperative live according to Nature meant\h
at bottom as much as live according to life\h\h

462
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:12,240
how could you not do that why make a principle\h
of what you yourselves are and must be end quote

463
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,820
so very wonderful passage um what's funny about\h
it is uh and and what's funny about Nietzsche's\h\h

464
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:26,280
criticism of the stoics is that I think these\h
charges could be levied at him to some extent\h\h

465
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,700
um I mean if Nietzsche is to have a life-affirming\h
philosophy right is he not guilty of also\h\h

466
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:41,220
extolling us to live according to life but I\h
would argue um being wife of affirming does not\h\h

467
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:48,420
mean that Nietzsche is affirming a certain path of\h
life as more natural or closer to life than others\h\h

468
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:55,860
rather with Nietzsche's insight one could\h
choose to accept the fundamental nature\h\h

469
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:01,140
of what life is or not one could\h
be grateful for being alive or not\h\h

470
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:09,360
um but whether you are of one temperament or\h
the other has nothing to do with Nietzsche right\h\h

471
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,340
um and I think Nietzsche has a real\h
point that many philosophers and many\h\h

472
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,720
ideologies and religions throughout\h
time have ultimately been anti-life\h\h

473
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:26,220
um and so I would because I think that is a\h
meaningful thing to talk about what is anti-life\h\h

474
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,800
I would reject the argument that it's like a\h
meaningless distinction there are real examples of\h\h

475
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:39,900
people who have said no to life right schopenhauer\h
Christianity Buddhism and so on um Nietzsche's I\h\h

476
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:45,540
mean and you know if of course if you phrase it\h
to a Christian like are you anti-life virtually no\h\h

477
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:53,760
Christian's gonna say yes to that but if you ask\h
them in more specific terms like is your you know\h\h

478
00:52:54,420 --> 00:53:00,120
is your like what is your life here worth compared\h
to what your uh whether your soul is saved you\h\h

479
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:05,400
go to heaven worth I mean they'll all tell you\h
that that the latter is way more important right

480
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:13,440
um and so I I think Nietzsche's definition\h
of these ideologies as anti-life uh and\h\h

481
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,000
distinguishing them from what a life-affirming\h
philosophy would be is actually descriptive\h\h

482
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:25,680
um whether we would agree that it he successfully\h
applied creates a philosophy of life or not right\h\h

483
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:32,100
but on the other hand um so Nietzsche here he's\h
making a principle of Will To Power and if Will\h\h

484
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:39,060
To Power is life why make a principle of what we\h
ourselves are and must be and perhaps the only\h\h

485
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:43,860
answer here is that Nietzsche is simply raising\h
this truth into our Consciousness and I don't\h\h

486
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:49,740
think he imagines that he can in any fundamental\h
way change the driving force of reality and\h\h

487
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:57,300
all human life and then again by expanding our\h
knowledge and our understanding we gain a greater\h\h

488
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,980
more complete perspective and if it happens to\h
follow from this that you make changes to your\h\h

489
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:07,200
life your way of life then so much the better but\h
just as zarathustra doesn't want us to follow him\h\h

490
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:14,580
um and wants to remind us that the poets lie too\h
much I think we can be safe in saying Nietzsche\h\h

491
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:20,880
um well he doesn't ever lay out a a list of\h
like these are the proper ways to manifest\h\h

492
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,920
your Will To Power right that's sort of\h
what I'm getting at now he does show ways\h\h

493
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:34,140
that are he points out a examples where manif\h
where will to power is turned against itself\h\h

494
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:42,360
and so that's sort of you know it's like if you\h
if you care about life you should probably avoid\h\h

495
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:48,000
the ways in which your life is going to be\h
um self-defeating or self-undermining right\h\h

496
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:58,620
um but uh we'll discuss this more you know as\h
we go on um but so from this this description\h\h

497
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:05,700
of what life is indifferent desolate and abundant\h
at the same time arbitrary and cruel in a sense\h\h

498
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:13,500
um so suppose we agree with that definition and\h
supposing this perception of what life is has been\h\h

499
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:20,880
raised into our consciousness the world would now\h
appear differently and our own way of life could\h\h

500
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:28,080
be brought under a more critical eye we might\h
have grounds to make new judgments and assessments\h\h

501
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:34,560
um and that's very important because what\h
comes out in this passage is living as\h\h

502
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:41,100
judging evaluating something I made reference\h
to earlier but as Nietzsche says in this quote\h\h

503
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:48,660
life is quote estimating preferring being unjust\h
being limited wanting to be different end quote\h\h

504
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:55,740
life is not a primarily self-preservative Force\h
it's a generating Force what life is is not the\h\h

505
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:01,080
passing on of the same genes that isn't really the\h
essence of life it would be the essence of life\h\h

506
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:08,520
would be again mutation endlessly individuating\h
forms becoming more complex more rarified more\h\h

507
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:16,620
specialized more speciated and notice this\h
process is fundamentally just as innocent as\h\h

508
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:22,320
it is arbitrary and unjust these preferences\h
these judgments aren't founded in reason\h\h

509
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,840
um you know they're just expressions of the\h
drives within the organisms reaching out\h\h

510
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,580
into the world reacting physiologically\h
when something gives pain or pleasure\h\h

511
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,500
or when something appears ugly or beautiful

512
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:41,400
um and so for example whether you find someone\h
else attractive or not beautiful or not it's\h\h

513
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,840
not in any way the product of a rational\h
syllogism or a well-considered argument or\h\h

514
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:51,600
a moral imperative and when I you know to\h
speak for myself when I look at the most\h\h

515
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:58,440
important things in my life I find almost none\h
of them derived from these things right life's\h\h

516
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:06,360
judgments are spontaneous non-rational preferences\h
it's Direct valuation on an intuitive level\h\h

517
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:13,440
uh let's look at another passage describing\h
what life is I probably the most important one\h\h

518
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:20,580
from the spokes orthostra this is an excerpt from\h
on self-overcoming which is a chapter from the\h\h

519
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:27,720
second part of the novel again zarathistra speaks\h
to us on the essence of living and he recounts\h\h

520
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:34,260
things that he has heard in an encounter with\h
the character of life itself life personified\h\h

521
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:41,400
and as the context for the passage\h
zerthustra prefaces all this by saying\h\h

522
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,120
that he's telling us this story so we\h
understand his words on Good and Evil\h\h

523
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:54,300
so we cannot understand zerothistra's morality and\h
his condemnation of good versus evil type moral\h\h

524
00:57:54,300 --> 00:58:01,200
systems until we understand what he believes\h
about life and living and so the passage quote

525
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:12,060
wherever I found the living there I heard also\h
the speech on obedience whatever lives obeys\h\h

526
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,780
and this is the second point he who\h
cannot obey himself is commanded\h\h

527
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:27,780
that is the nature of the living this however is\h
the third point that I heard that commanding is\h\h

528
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:34,860
harder than obeying and not only because he who\h
commands must carry the burden of all who obey\h\h

529
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:40,620
and because this burden May easily crush\h
him an experiment in Hazard appeared to\h\h

530
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:45,780
me to be in all commanding and whenever\h
the living commands it hazards itself\h\h

531
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:54,420
indeed even when it commands itself it must\h
still pay for its commanding it must become the\h\h

532
00:58:54,420 --> 00:59:04,140
judge Avenger and the victim of its own law end\h
quote and so remember morality is self-overcoming\h\h

533
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:08,760
the inner character of morality is\h
Will To Power like everything else\h\h

534
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:16,020
uh what is morality it is and the language of this\h
passage issuing commands to oneself completely\h\h

535
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:23,520
absent from this vision is anything like freedom\h
of the will or the libertarian application of uh\h\h

536
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,620
you know some quality of reason to govern Human\h
Action rather it's simply a question of whether\h\h

537
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:35,940
one has the strength to command oneself and if\h
not then one shall be commanded his drives rather\h\h

538
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:42,240
than the other way around there's no detaunt\h
no equilibrium the choice is to command or be\h\h

539
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:55,320
commanded and in a way in a way they both sort\h
of imply uh one another um but uh yeah the idea\h\h

540
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:00,660
is that it's always better to be Commander too is\h
short-sighted all life is an experiment in most\h\h

541
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:08,160
experiments fail right so to dare to allow your\h
judgments your non-rational arbitrary preferences\h\h

542
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:14,460
that your will is aimed at to reshape your\h
world and to even bind others Wills to your own

543
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:20,220
um or just on the more basic level\h
to take command of your own life\h\h

544
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:25,620
and reshape it into an artistic pattern\h
right giving style as nietzsa says these\h\h

545
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:30,600
are dangerous experiments and most people\h
throughout history do not do this experiment\h\h

546
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:38,940
most people throughout time live their life in\h
accord with the inherited conventional pattern\h\h

547
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:46,080
and yet there's this driving will beneath us\h
all and always this tendency for some number\h\h

548
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:54,000
of us to burst forward attempting to be different\h
and to Define ourselves individually and you know\h\h

549
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,640
like but how many Aquatic Life forms suffocated\h
above the water until some muted some of them\h\h

550
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:05,760
mutated into forms that could endure like more\h
and more exposure to the oxygen atmosphere right\h\h

551
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:15,300
so advancement requires vast sacrifices and as\h
this passage indicates we always have to we always\h\h

552
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:22,620
have to pay for it in some way it's a reality\h
of life um but the passage gets tougher still\h\h

553
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:29,820
quotes where I found the living\h
there I found Will To Power\h\h

554
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:34,440
and even in the will of those who\h
serve I found the will to be master\h\h

555
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:42,180
that the weaker should serve the stronger to\h
that it is persuaded by its own will which\h\h

556
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:47,760
would be Master over what is weak or still this\h
is the one pleasure it does not want to renounce\h\h

557
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:54,780
and as the smaller yields to the greater that it\h
may have pleasure and power over the smallest thus\h\h

558
01:01:54,780 --> 01:02:02,640
even the greatest still yields and for the sake\h
of power risks life that is the yielding of the\h\h

559
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:10,440
greater it is Hazard and danger and casting\h
dice for death and where men make sacrifices\h\h

560
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:19,500
and serve and cast Amorous glances there too is\h
the will to be master along stealthy paths the\h\h

561
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:25,920
weaker Steels into the castle and into the very\h
heart of the more powerful and there steals power\h\h

562
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:36,900
and life confided the secret to me behold it\h
said I am that which must always overcome itself\h\h

563
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:44,400
indeed you call it a will to procreate\h
or a drive to an end to something higher\h\h

564
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:55,320
farther more manifold but all this is one and one\h
Secret rather would I perish then forswear this\h\h

565
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:04,440
and verily where there is perishing and a falling\h
of leaves behold their life sacrifices itself\h\h

566
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:12,960
for power that I must be a struggle and to\h
be coming and an end and an opposition to\h\h

567
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:21,180
ends alas whoever guesses what is my will should\h
also guess on what crooked paths it must proceed\h\h

568
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:28,920
whatever I create and however much I\h
love it soon I must oppose it and my love\h\h

569
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:36,600
thus my will wills it and you too lover of\h
knowledge are only a path and a footprint\h\h

570
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:45,900
of my will my Will To Power walks also on the\h
heels of your will to truth indeed the truth\h\h

571
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:54,240
was not hit by him who shot at it with the word\h
of will to existence that will does not exist\h\h

572
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:02,040
for what does not exist cannot will but what is\h
in existence how could that still want existence\h\h

573
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:11,100
only where there is life is there also will not\h
will to life but thus I teach you will to power\h\h

574
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:16,920
there is much that life esteems\h
more highly than life itself\h\h

575
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:23,400
but out of the esteeming itself\h
speaks Will To Power end quote

576
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:31,320
so we have the repudiation at the end\h
there of schopenhauer's idea of the\h\h

577
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:37,200
will to exist or the will to live we have the\h
idea that life is that which overcomes itself\h\h

578
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:46,140
and that life sacrifices itself for power and that\h
this is the fundamental nature of Will's power\h\h

579
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:55,260
meaning life itself is Will To Power is\h
self-overcoming self life is judging praising\h\h

580
01:04:55,260 --> 01:05:01,620
being different as we if we were to draw in\h
from the other path passage and the basis\h\h

581
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:07,560
of all of this is physiological preference\h
and as such the nature of life is valuing\h\h

582
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:14,160
another way of saying that is how he brings it\h
out at the end here saying that to lives to esteem\h\h

583
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:21,180
if we are to be the measure of things which all\h
life must be for itself and for its own kind then\h\h

584
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:26,640
we must self-legislate that good just as the\h
hawk must determine its own good and the lamb\h\h

585
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:32,280
must determine its own good right but we humans\h
it's a little different because we perhaps value\h\h

586
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:37,380
more powerfully and more subtly than any other\h
being ever has and that's why our Will To Power\h\h

587
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:45,540
precedes un crooked paths even those in a position\h
of servitude have their ways of gaining power over\h\h

588
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:52,140
the Masters we can find the expressions of Will To\h
Power in the most subtle ways whether in charity\h\h

589
01:05:52,140 --> 01:06:00,420
and patronage or in subterfusion infidelity all\h
manner of human behaviors and tendencies present\h\h

590
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:05,820
themselves in our cognition as wholly separate\h
from this fundamental character of life we hide it\h\h

591
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:12,600
behind ideas like the search for the truth but the\h
high estimation of Truth just like the estimations\h\h

592
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:20,760
we make of any phenomena speak to the fact that\h
steaming itself is our nature judging valuing\h\h

593
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:27,900
measuring is nature it is a prerequisite for\h
any such evaluation and within this fundamental\h\h

594
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:34,800
activity we see the essence of Worlds of power the\h
willingness to impose our standards upon reality\h\h

595
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:41,040
and then manifest those standards with force\h
and when we zoom out so to speak and consider\h\h

596
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:47,700
the total picture of life Life as a whole is\h
always doing this meaning that life is constantly\h\h

597
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:53,700
judging which forms or biological patterns\h
are worthy of esteem and which ones are not\h\h

598
01:06:54,300 --> 01:07:00,540
insofar as this war of all against all takes\h
place continually across generations of life\h\h

599
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:05,940
forms all eating each other and competing for\h
the feeding ground and the right to reproduce\h\h

600
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:11,880
so with this perhaps uh somewhat\h
troubling picture of what life is\h\h

601
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:18,600
and who we are as living beings is there such a\h
thing as the good life Nietzsche would obviously\h\h

602
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:24,000
say yes and although his conception of it\h
changes a little bit throughout his career\h\h

603
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:28,860
in his early days he believes that\h
life can be aesthetically Justified\h\h

604
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:37,740
this is as he writes in uh birth of tragedy\h
and this has a sense to it if life is basically\h\h

605
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:44,340
arbitrary estimations on the direct perceptual\h
level why can't the good life Simply Be The\h\h

606
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:50,100
Beautiful Life if we're living according to\h
brute preference why not aesthetic preference\h\h

607
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:56,820
um this particular form of aesthetic\h
preference Nietzsche advocates is what\h\h

608
01:07:56,820 --> 01:08:03,000
we might call the tragic perspective on life\h
this is the perspective cultivated artistically\h\h

609
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:11,160
through a dramatic tragedy in ancient Greece of a\h
cheerful fatalism in the face of one's destruction\h\h

610
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:15,900
we can better understand this view\h
by what Nietzsche opposes it to\h\h

611
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,520
he opposes this view to what he calls the\h
theoretic approach which begins with Socrates\h\h

612
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:26,280
and birth of tragedy he writes of the\h
cultural divide between theoretic and\h\h

613
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:31,740
the tragic the theoretical life is a life lived\h
according to reason according to the view that\h\h

614
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:37,200
human problems can be solved by reason in a\h
lasting way and human life and Society can be\h\h

615
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:44,160
improved by reason it is fundamentally a form\h
of optimism and the best representative for it\h\h

616
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:49,080
is Socrates because he offers the strongest\h
and most noteworthy case for this worldview\h\h

617
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:55,320
an important point in all this is\h
that socrates's view is for Nietzsche\h\h

618
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:04,320
ultimately an aesthetic view Socrates is at bottom\h
driven by an irrational estimation of the truth\h\h

619
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:11,040
that's uh Nietzsche's fundamental criticism of him\h
and I think the various Paths of ideas or thoughts\h\h

620
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:16,140
that one could follow just from the explosive\h
quality of that initial statement you know that\h\h

621
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:21,660
initial accusation in niche's career it contains\h
all the seeds of Nietzsche's later philosophy\h\h

622
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:27,300
but in any case so he presents Socrates and birth\h
of tragedy as totally unartistic but he clarifies\h\h

623
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:33,840
in his later preface to the work that socrates's\h
irony is that very thing that he irrationally\h\h

624
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:40,980
valued the truth about all things and that this is\h
in itself an expression of socrates's underlying\h\h

625
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:48,000
nature his arbitrary demand for life his demand\h
that all reality be bound under one universal\h\h

626
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,060
principle of reason and that all illusions of\h
superstition and Prejudice be banned because\h\h

627
01:09:54,060 --> 01:10:01,740
under this Socratic aesthetic those things are\h
ugly and so it's all socrates's aesthetic judgment\h\h

628
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:07,980
any questions was that oh great ironist was\h
that perhaps your irony now Nietzsche's opposing\h\h

629
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:15,300
aesthetic Outlook is one which is pessimistic and\h
again Nietzsche believes he's a rather positive\h\h

630
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:21,000
representative of the Outlook Because he believes\h
himself to be a pessimist of strength and thus the\h\h

631
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,700
tragic worldview is the affirmation of all of the\h
character of life that we just discussed with the\h\h

632
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:34,500
full realization that this entails the Embrace of\h
one's own downfall we do not accept any optimistic\h\h

633
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:41,460
or morally redeeming narratives about life and\h
embrace wholeheartedly that entropy always wins\h\h

634
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:50,520
life is short the Good Die Young bad things happen\h
to good people pride comes before the fall history\h\h

635
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:56,640
is a series of cycles of a rise followed by a fall\h
just like all organisms are born and then they die\h\h

636
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:02,760
but one does not count any of these\h
honestly ascertained aspects of\h\h

637
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:09,360
human life as charges against it the\h
tragic aesthetic instead is defined by\h\h

638
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:17,340
emphasizing the beauty inherent to the\h
fundamentally entropic nature of life story seen\h\h

639
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:24,180
in total of a tragic figure is somehow beautiful\h
to us and Nietzsche believes that this experience\h\h

640
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:30,840
occurs when we engage with the tragic because we\h
are confronting the terrifying reality of life\h\h

641
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:38,400
in such a manner that it does not immediately\h
destroy us right and so we feel that we are\h\h

642
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,120
through the experience of tragic art\h
overcoming the terrifying nature of\h\h

643
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:48,060
the World by encountering it and surviving it by\h
that token to use a heretical word in this context\h\h

644
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:56,880
transcending it and turning it into art\h
the experience of uh beauty or the sublime

645
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:04,140
now Nietzsche didn't stick with this answer as\h
to what the good life is because this answer\h\h

646
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:11,640
I mean like any other answer to the question\h
of what the good life is his perspectable to\h\h

647
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,900
really answer the question in general terms\h
we have to make it into a meta question\h\h

648
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:25,200
what later Nietzsche eventually concludes in\h
a mindset more of that type in the metal world\h\h

649
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:31,380
uh what he later concludes it's related to\h
his understanding of what every attempt at\h\h

650
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:35,700
creating the good life has been\h
and that is the will to power\h\h

651
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:42,420
that the will to power is expressed in\h
the socratic quest to know the truth in\h\h

652
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:48,480
order to practice virtue as much as Will To\h
Power is expressed in the Christian ethos to\h\h

653
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:53,640
love thy enemy and resist not evil or the\h
Buddhist ethos to renounce selfish craving\h\h

654
01:12:54,840 --> 01:13:01,500
all are forms of self overcoming and all our\h
attempts to impose a judgment on the world\h\h

655
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:10,620
Nietzsche then inquires about the direction in\h
which this transformation proceeds or how these\h\h

656
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:19,080
judgments on the world eventually manifest in\h
human life and the reason why he does this is\h\h

657
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:24,180
because in seeing that element of Will To Power\h
and all of these answers and how each one is\h\h

658
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:29,940
sort of from a different perspective right but\h
it's always manifesting this world's power thing\h\h

659
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:36,360
um I think he's able to see that his\h
own attempt to impose an aesthetic\h\h

660
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:41,340
judgment on the world was actually\h
not a newer Innovative thing at all\h\h

661
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,420
or Innovative notion um that it's simply\h
what every religion has been trying to do\h\h

662
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:55,740
and that the real question that we should\h
be asking is why is it that all of these\h\h

663
01:13:55,740 --> 01:14:00,300
Aesthetics that already exist do not work for\h
us anymore that might be one way to put it\h\h

664
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:06,480
so what is it that these various moralities and\h
religions have given rise to and in a strong sense\h\h

665
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:11,460
Nietzsche is very empirical here all the various\h
manifestations of the world's power have these\h\h

666
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:16,620
fundamental characteristics that we've described\h
but not all its manifestations are created equal\h\h

667
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:23,520
accordingly some ways of life are stronger\h
and some are weaker or we might say healthier\h\h

668
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:29,520
or sicker or to put it in the language we used\h
earlier some are ascending Paths of life meaning\h\h

669
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:35,460
that these are expressions of strength which give\h
rise to more strength but some are descending\h\h

670
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:40,800
which represents a degeneration into weaker and\h
weaker forms so it's still a manifestation of your\h\h

671
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,380
strength but it's a manifestation of your strength\h
that get doesn't give rise to more strength but to\h\h

672
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:53,400
um but to weakness and so um it's the difference\h
between a positive feedback loop and a negative\h\h

673
01:14:53,400 --> 01:15:00,780
feedback loop and so the good life is the\h
positive feedback loop that is the healthy\h\h

674
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:05,700
life in the sense of this the life-affirming\h
life right and we should remind ourselves at\h\h

675
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:11,820
this point that while this statement does have a\h
very figurative Dimension to it it also has a very\h\h

676
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:20,880
um literal dimension because the root of this\h
all is still what physiological our judgments and\h\h

677
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:28,680
preferences occur at that physiological level and\h
so one strength to order their drives according\h\h

678
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:33,780
to such a life ascending manifestation of will\h
that's determined at the physiological level\h\h

679
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:40,200
if we're going to take seriously the idea that\h
human beings are bodies that what we are is what\h\h

680
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:46,200
we appear to be by all observation in the world of\h
direct perception than where physical beings and\h\h

681
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:53,940
our psychic life in the sense of the psychological\h
right as well as our social life and their our\h\h

682
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:59,100
moral life all of this sort of flows out of the\h
headwaters of our own nature of the conditions\h\h

683
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:05,820
that produced us aspects of our temperament um\h
but another way to look at it would be like maybe\h\h

684
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:12,060
how much physical Vitality we have or we\h
might say how much Vitality do we have left\h\h

685
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:18,960
and so Nietzsche believes that weak or\h
self-undermining moral values for example\h\h

686
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:24,960
are at bottom the product of\h
a weary degenerating person\h\h

687
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:33,960
and that this is true in some sense of them\h
physiologically as well as psychologically\h\h

688
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:40,860
and so that's the root of everything we\h
are so we look at it in the physical sense\h\h

689
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:45,240
um I mean on the other hand though it's\h
entirely possible for someone who's young\h\h

690
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:53,220
and otherwise physiologically healthy to have\h
a weary or degenerative view of life and life\h\h

691
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:59,160
is not a frozen thing again it's not being\h
so we can't inquire as to whether someone's\h\h

692
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:05,280
way of life is apparently healthy uh in the\h
here and now and then have done with it right\h\h

693
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:11,700
we are viewing people as human becomings\h
rather than human beings as a dynamic process\h\h

694
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:16,440
which is ever unfolding and never really\h
standing still and so like with everything\h\h

695
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:21,720
we can't really say whether life is\h
healthy until we know what it led to\h\h

696
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:28,140
what did it give rise to right and so we always\h
have to remember in pursuing the good life\h\h

697
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:34,440
um the important thing is what we spend our\h
lives uh what are we what direction are we\h\h

698
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:40,500
moving in what are we bringing forth if we try\h
to hold on to our life or hold on to it the way\h\h

699
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:46,740
it is now from a Devotion to the self-preservative\h
Instinct will will always fail in that task right\h\h

700
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:52,260
when it's all over you'll be gone anyway and and\h
uh all that's going to be left is whatever it is\h\h

701
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:59,220
you've given rise to it's not really an option\h
but so what is the good life to Nature we're\h\h

702
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:05,280
still sort of answering this question and with all\h
of that all this piece isn't a place we could say\h\h

703
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,860
this is where the concept of the younger man comes\h
into play It's the good life is in so many words\h\h

704
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:17,160
to live in such a way that you bring forth the\h
over man and this simply means to live in such\h\h

705
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:22,380
a way that your life is aimed at bringing forth\h
something greater than you are it means to live\h\h

706
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:28,320
your life and longing for something beyond your\h
current Horizons and it means being willing to\h\h

707
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:35,460
make sacrifices which emphasizes a lot to spend\h
yourself and your life and spend Your vitality\h\h

708
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:42,660
and in this the over man is the promise of\h
the Redemption of mankind from all its faults\h\h

709
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:49,080
it's a dare I say it faith and the\h
ascendance of Life winning out over\h\h

710
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:54,120
the degeneration of life it's faith\h
in the positive feedback loop of life

711
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:01,860
um and so can we say in general terms what that\h
good life looks like I mean well we see it in\h\h

712
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:08,280
zarathus just prologue and the tightrope Walker\h
the jester I mean the literal word translation\h\h

713
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:15,180
means rope dancer um there it's roughly equivalent\h
to what we would mean by a tight rope Walker but\h\h

714
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:21,000
you have the word dancer there in in German and\h
so uh you know that's very important because in\h\h

715
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,780
Nietzsche dancing has such a metaphor for you\h
know the expression of the deepest happiness\h\h

716
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:34,080
of the you know anyway uh so the Rope dancer\h
the sort of clownish character this gesture\h\h

717
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:39,660
lives his life in practice of a dangerous\h
craft and he dies while performing his craft\h\h

718
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:48,900
and um zarathustra you know uh Praises him in in\h
some sense it's Nietzsche's exaltation to us to\h\h

719
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:55,740
live dangerously build your temples on the slopes\h
of Mount Vesuvius so fully commit to your great\h\h

720
01:19:55,740 --> 01:20:00,660
passions in life and be honest about what it is\h
that drives you which is something that may take\h\h

721
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:07,080
you years to explore and come to any understanding\h
of and many great and dangerous experiments\h\h

722
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:13,260
to see of what happens when you let\h
certain drives Take the Wheel so to speak\h\h

723
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:23,940
um so let's look at some examples of good\h
lives which I think might be instructive um\h\h

724
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:30,300
Nietzsche would suggest we look to if we want an\h
example of the good life and the nietzsian sense\h\h

725
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:39,780
should look to figures such as Getta a true\h
Renaissance Man I mean he wrote beautifully\h\h

726
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:43,320
in every style of literature expanded\h
the possibilities for the German language\h\h

727
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:52,080
um had this vast catalog of poems and guerta\h
stands as a soul torn between classical Aesthetics\h\h

728
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:59,520
and the fiery passion of Romanticism or we could\h
consider a non-artist a completely non-theoretical\h\h

729
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:06,900
man a man praised by the aforementioned in fact as\h
much as by Hegel and many of the intellectuals of\h\h

730
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:13,620
his time Napoleon Bonaparte Napoleon emerges from\h
the chaos and the excess of the French Revolution\h\h

731
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:20,340
in order to produce a new French Empire and in\h
the process he constructs the modern French state\h\h

732
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:26,460
and he is by the Numbers the most effective\h
military commander of all time but to this very\h\h

733
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:34,440
day and by a mile and so just as good to reshaped\h
the German artistic landscape in his own image\h\h

734
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:41,280
Napoleon reshaped the French political landscape\h
in his own image these were men who dared to\h\h

735
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:48,360
command to follow the dictates of their will\h
and impose their judgments and that was a risk a\h\h

736
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:54,840
hazard as Napoleon says when Fortune is done with\h
him quote she will break me like a glass end quote\h\h

737
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:01,980
but you know most won't measure up to these\h
examples many will fail some like Caesar will\h\h

738
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:07,200
succeed but in their moment of Triumph when\h
their Victory is barely drawn a breath they\h\h

739
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:13,260
meet their downfall but in the image of such\h
people whether we find it attainable or not\h\h

740
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,780
we may find the inspiration to\h
attempt to emulate The Good Life

741
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:25,740
in Twilight of idols the section\h
skirmishes of an untimely man\h\h

742
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,740
number 48 we find this passage\h
which references Napoleon\h\h

743
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:39,600
and speaks of him in the language of being\h
this ideal for what ascending life looks like\h\h

744
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:46,860
Nietzsche makes reference to the idea of a\h
return to Nature and I think there he's primarily\h\h

745
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:55,740
rebutting the rason ideals concerning what such a\h
thing would entail uh quote progress in my sense\h\h

746
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:03,300
I too speak of Return To Nature although it\h
is really not a going back but a going up\h\h

747
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:09,480
an Ascent to the high free even\h
terrible nature and naturalness\h\h

748
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:14,640
where great tasks are something\h
one plays with one may play with\h\h

749
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:22,200
to put it metaphorically Napoleon was a piece\h
of Return To Nature as I understand the phrase\h\h

750
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:31,380
for example and Rebus tacticus even more as\h
military men know in matters of strategy end quote\h\h

751
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:40,200
so he references their Napoleon's extraordinary\h
record as a tactician and the fact that he was\h\h

752
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:51,060
a very he was a man who acted it seemed on an\h
instinct right uh so Nietzsche often speaks of\h\h

753
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:55,200
great and terrible individuals right and there are\h
many ways in which we could take that description\h\h

754
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:00,960
but at bottom I think the important thing he's\h
getting at the essentially innocent nature of all\h\h

755
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:06,420
of our drives innocent because they're natural\h
innocent in the way that it's innocent when\h\h

756
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:12,300
a hawk eats a little field mouse right the\h
high free terrible naturalness he speaks of\h\h

757
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:19,200
as a human being who's recaptured this sense\h
of innocence and thus is free to follow the\h\h

758
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:25,740
commands of his own will because he's freed from\h
imposing guilt or imposing moral condemnation upon\h\h

759
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:32,040
those drives and so yes such a person might\h
end up doing what we would call evil things\h\h

760
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:36,600
but that's by no means the focus of\h
what Nietzsche is talking about here\h\h

761
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:44,760
um you know Napoleon's not great because of like\h
a body count right that would be a rather morbid\h\h

762
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:51,300
um the point of living the good life is not to\h
do evil things I mean it's the moralists will\h\h

763
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:58,260
try and scare us by making us uh you know\h
think that that's what any sort of belief\h\h

764
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:06,540
in life in the world outside of a Transcendent or\h
Divine Telos that's what that means but Nietzsche\h\h

765
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:11,100
Nietzsche is just simply demanding of\h
himself that he'd be honest with us here\h\h

766
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:18,540
and admit that a return to innocent human nature\h
in fact means getting in touch with a part of\h\h

767
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:25,980
ourselves which is passionate domineering\h
and at times violent and unreasonable\h\h

768
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:32,940
in the very next section of Twilight of Idols\h
Nietzsche gives us his assessment of Gita this\h\h

769
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:42,780
is section 49 quote get her not a German event but\h
a European one a magnificent attempt to overcome\h\h

770
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:49,740
the 18th century by a return to Nature by an\h
Ascent to the naturalness of the Renaissance\h\h

771
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:57,180
kind of self-overcoming on the part of that\h
century he bore its strongest instincts within\h\h

772
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:05,340
himself the sensibility the idolatry of nature\h
the anti-historic the idealistic the unreal and\h\h

773
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:11,400
revolutionary the latter merely being a form\h
of the unreal he sought help from history\h\h

774
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:19,200
Natural Science Antiquity and also Spinoza but\h
above all from practical activity he surrounded\h\h

775
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:24,660
himself with limited Horizons he did not retire\h
from life but put himself into the midst of it\h\h

776
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:32,460
he was not faint-hearted but took as much as\h
possible upon himself over himself into himself\h\h

777
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:40,800
what he wanted was totality he fought the mutual\h
extraneousness of Reason senses feeling and will\h\h

778
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:47,040
preached with the most abhorrent\h
scholasticism by Kant the antipode of ghetta\h\h

779
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:51,720
he disciplined himself to\h
wholeness he created himself\h\h

780
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:57,540
in the middle of an age with an unreal\h
Outlook ghetto was a convinced realist\h\h

781
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:03,720
he said yes to everything that was related to him\h
in this respect and he had no greater experience\h\h

782
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:11,700
than that inzrealism most real being called\h
Napoleon Goethe conceived a human being who would\h\h

783
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:18,480
be strong Highly Educated skillful in all bodily\h
matters self-controlled reverent toward himself\h\h

784
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:23,520
and who might dare to afford the whole range\h
and wealth of being natural being strong enough\h\h

785
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:30,240
for such freedom the man of Tolerance not from\h
weakness but from strength because he knows how to\h\h

786
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:36,720
use his to his Advantage even that from which the\h
average nature would perish the Man For Whom there\h\h

787
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:41,820
is no longer anything that is forbidden unless\h
it be weakness whether called Vice or virtue\h\h

788
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:49,320
such a spirit who has become free stands amid\h
the cosmos with a joyous and trusting fatalism\h\h

789
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:56,340
in the Fate that only the particular is loathsome\h
and that all is redeemed and affirmed in the whole\h\h

790
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:03,240
he does not negate anymore such a faith\h
however is the highest of all possible faiths\h\h

791
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:08,040
I have baptized it with the\h
name of Dionysus end quote

792
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:15,780
and so very clear terms\h
Nietzsche calls Gerta dianesian\h\h

793
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,400
but in a very specific meaning of the\h
dionysian which we've talked about\h\h

794
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:27,780
so in comparing and contrasting you know\h
the profiles of Napoleon and Gerta surely\h\h

795
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:31,920
both are candidates for what Nietzsche would\h
call The Good Life and we have a more or less\h\h

796
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:37,920
adequate picture of what it entails naturalness\h
straightforwardness and a trusting fatalism

797
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:45,720
um and of course you know the fact that both\h
create something great beyond themselves which is\h\h

798
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:52,500
an imposition of their creative will and reality\h
but the fatalism aspect you know in other places\h\h

799
01:28:52,500 --> 01:29:00,540
Nietzsche critical criticized um excuse me uh\h
criticized a fatalistic attitude in the sense\h\h

800
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:07,380
of being oppressed or like abound fatalism what he\h
disparagingly calls Muhammad in fatalism but this\h\h

801
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:12,480
trusting fatalism that he describes is different\h
it's trusting in life trusting in necessity\h\h

802
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:19,740
um feeling that everything is redeemed in\h
the whole right um that in the whole picture\h\h

803
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:28,560
um life is more beautiful than it is ugly\h
we might say and um you know in the full\h\h

804
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:33,060
awareness of the danger Napoleon brought upon\h
himself but you know without a care for it\h\h

805
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:38,700
he pursues this ambitious course in life\h
that's a perfect example of trusting fatalism

806
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:46,920
um and the fruits of such a natural healthy life\h
are Freedom gratitude a sense of cheerfulness\h\h

807
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:51,840
but notice it's not uh when we're talking\h
about a life that's free and natural\h\h

808
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:56,640
remember when Nietzsche describes Gerta as a\h
return to Nature he's already said what that\h\h

809
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:02,700
means and that there's this inherently it's like\h
his conception of what that means is a nature that\h\h

810
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:10,920
is inherently sort of uh violent and dangerous but\h
those who most profoundly mantle that role in life\h\h

811
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:16,860
become something that's almost more\h
than human more like a cataclysmic event\h\h

812
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:24,540
shock wave that rocks an entire continent a force\h
that reshapes an entire culture launches an entire\h\h

813
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:32,400
artistic movement and so in this context perhaps\h
we might look at the third question what what\h\h

814
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:40,200
facilitates the good life this is in effect\h
a question of Nietzsche and virtues and again\h\h

815
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:47,700
while we may consider these examples uh we must\h
understand that the passages that I'm going to\h\h

816
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:52,860
read in this respect don't refer to any absolute\h
claim of morality or Universal application for\h\h

817
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:59,400
all the reasons we've already talked about um you\h
know everyone has their own way their own virtues\h\h

818
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:05,040
to cultivate and so on Nietzsche says that your\h
most precious virtues will be known to you alone\h\h

819
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:10,080
and you will not even have a name for them right\h
because the most personal things are the things\h\h

820
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:16,200
which can't be shared by the universal word\h
Concepts that we communicate with via language\h\h

821
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:25,560
um but Nietzsche nevertheless offers us a few\h
uh suggestions about the cultivation of a good\h\h

822
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:30,960
life and so there are a few reliable pieces of\h
wisdom he has for those of us who wish to live a\h\h

823
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:38,160
healthy life uh this isn't Beyond Good and Evil\h
284. I'll quote here in an Abridged form quote\h\h

824
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:47,160
to live with tremendous and proud composure\h
always Beyond to have and not to have one's\h\h

825
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:55,080
effects one's pro and con at will to condescend\h
to them for a few hours to seat oneself on them\h\h

826
01:31:55,080 --> 01:32:02,700
as a horse often as on an ass for one must know\h
how to make use of their stupidity as much as\h\h

827
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:08,280
of their fire and to choose for company\h
that impish and cheerful Vice courtesy\h\h

828
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:17,520
and to remain master of one's four Virtues\h
Of Courage Insight sympathy and solitude\h\h

829
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:25,260
for Solitude is a virtue for us as a Sublime\h
bent and urge for cleanliness which guesses\h\h

830
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:32,280
how all contact between man and man in\h
society involves inevitable uncleanliness\h\h

831
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:45,240
all Community makes men somehow somewhere sometime\h
common end quote so for virtues here first courage\h\h

832
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:51,840
this is required for the good life because courage\h
is required for any Command Decision right an act\h\h

833
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:58,440
of will we might say um because as we said during\h
the act in one's own will on one's own judgments\h\h

834
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:06,540
is dangerous and we have insight which means\h
not acting based on superficial qualities or\h\h

835
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:12,960
Surface level observations that would just see\h
you misled and would be counterproductive these\h\h

836
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:18,180
virtues are very uh virtuous stick in the old\h
sense of the word right in terms of efficiency\h\h

837
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,760
sympathy is an odd one for Nietzsche one might\h
think especially because He follows it up with\h\h

838
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:29,700
Solitude which he justifies by saying that all\h
participation in society makes us unclean and\h\h

839
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:34,200
he means I think intellectually morally\h
emotionally unclean right we're getting\h\h

840
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:39,720
uh communicated all these uh sort of sick\h
herd values into our heads more in society\h\h

841
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:48,120
um but this reveals I think that we have two\h
sort of couplets within the four which are\h\h

842
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:52,500
sort of counterbalancing you know you need to\h
be courageous which means suspending judgment\h\h

843
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:59,280
and acting uh or like suspending deliberation\h
and acting it's a better way to put it and yet\h\h

844
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:06,120
one also needs Insight which means not acting\h
blindly or based on short-term interests that\h\h

845
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:12,420
are in the long term sense unhealthy right so\h
sort of a counterbalance to the capacity for\h\h

846
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:20,640
Action that you need in Courage uh Insight is the\h
capacity for reflection in some sense and then uh\h\h

847
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:26,520
you know we also need a sense of sympathy a\h
sincere heartfelt emotional connection to other\h\h

848
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:31,800
human beings that's natural uh for human beings\h
as much as anything else we've been talking about\h\h

849
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:37,620
um it's natural between members of a family or\h
with people we love and it it's required that we\h\h

850
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:44,700
that it exists to some extent in order to function\h
in society it's the basis of all things like you\h\h

851
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:50,820
know courtesy and respect and charity many of\h
these socially beneficial behaviors and attitudes\h\h

852
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:55,920
that are required for civilization as a\h
project to continue and yet if we truly\h\h

853
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:01,440
want greatness in our lives Solitude is\h
required one has to be able to leave the\h\h

854
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:05,220
endless all-pervasive influence of\h
the thoughts of others this chorus\h\h

855
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:12,240
of Judge judging voices all around us that\h
render our own individual judgments moot\h\h

856
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:19,680
or our experimental judgments forbidden right\h
declare them immoral harmful dangerous and so\h\h

857
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:25,980
the judgmental voice of the majority exists\h
with us at all times in the form of conscience\h\h

858
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:32,580
and it's more strongly felt the more often we're\h
exposed to the judgments of others and that makes\h\h

859
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:38,820
us all common as he says somehow some way it\h
imparts some of the same thoughts or the same\h\h

860
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:44,340
types of thoughts and so for someone to live the\h
good life and to bring forth something greater\h\h

861
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:50,460
something stronger something healthier they\h
have to be able to move outside of the current\h\h

862
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:56,880
cultural moral software one has to\h
cultivate the ability to think their\h\h

863
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:02,640
own thoughts because that's the only way to\h
go beyond the current values which that's the\h\h

864
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:06,840
possibility of the great individual who\h
reshapes said values creates new things\h\h

865
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:14,640
Anita has another set of four virtues in a\h
different place in the book Daybreak or the dawn\h\h

866
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:22,320
this is section 556 it's similar but it's\h
not exactly the same uh list of Virtues\h\h

867
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:28,080
but we can see a similar reasoning here so\h
this is a different list as it appears quote\h\h

868
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:35,940
the good four honest with ourselves and whoever\h
else is our friend courageous with the Enemy\h\h

869
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:45,660
magnanimous with the vanquished courteous always\h
thus the four cardinal virtues want us end quote\h\h

870
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:53,580
so courage is included in both out of these two\h
lists of four the total seven cardinal nietzsian\h\h

871
01:36:53,580 --> 01:37:02,160
virtues would be courage Insight sympathy\h
Solitude courtesy magnanimity and honesty\h\h

872
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:09,000
and I hope everyone can hear when I say the\h
phrase card Cardinal niche in virtues that my\h\h

873
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:14,040
tongue is in my cheek here nevertheless that's\h
as good a list of Virtues as any religions ever\h\h

874
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:20,700
produced and maybe better than any religion has\h
produced in far insofar as uh we have solitude\h\h

875
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:26,040
as a virtue it's a masterful idea and\h
a unique contribution of Nietzsche\h\h

876
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:32,040
uh Kaufman points out in a footnote to\h
the good four passage that Plato also\h\h

877
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:39,300
has for cardinal virtues which are wisdom\h
courage Temperance and justice um so that's\h\h

878
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:45,480
interesting courage appears in both Nietzsche's\h
lists and in Plato's there's some additional\h\h

879
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:50,040
overlap and that you know wisdom and insight\h
probably could be roughly considered analogous\h\h

880
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:57,900
um temperance kind of similar to magnanimity to\h
some degree but it's interesting the way in which\h\h

881
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:03,660
they contradict one another because Justice is\h
absent from Nietzsche's list and in fact something\h\h

882
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:10,620
like justice would generally be considered a vice\h
for Nietzsche zarathistra says in the passage on\h\h

883
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:16,800
the tarantulas that if you know for the culture\h
Warrior who's totally concerned with Justice the\h\h

884
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:23,640
thing that actually stands behind that word is the\h
desire for Revenge says the Bridge To His Highest\h\h

885
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:30,180
Hope For Humanity and a rainbow after long storms\h
is that mankind shall be delivered from Revenge\h\h

886
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:35,700
as if he's redeeming man from a sin we\h
might say to belabor the point right\h\h

887
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:42,420
so look to the cheerful trusting fatalism that\h
Nietzsche mentioned earlier in describing guerta\h\h

888
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:48,900
and which could also be applied to Napoleon\h
why such a fatalistic Embrace of necessity\h\h

889
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:56,220
because in this world as Will To Power we\h
find nothing of guilt or moral responsibility\h\h

890
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:03,720
and so if we're dutiful to the virtue of\h
insight we consider our in our feelings\h\h

891
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:08,160
and actions involving others that everyone we\h
encounter is entirely innocent of any wrongdoing\h\h

892
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:13,860
all we encounter is simply manifestations of\h
the will to power pushing and pulling against\h\h

893
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:19,800
us or attracting and repulsing us and the person\h
who does you harm is no more immoral than when\h\h

894
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:26,220
a hurricane does you harm or when a mad dog bites\h
you or when you you know when you open the cabinet\h\h

895
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:30,600
and a jar of something falls and hits you on the\h
head you don't Factor morality into those things\h\h

896
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:37,200
you might still get angry you might be physically\h
harmed or even emotionally uh you know aggrieved\h\h

897
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:43,440
by it but when all is said and done The Virtuous\h
person maintains the degree of equanimity with the\h\h

898
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:49,020
knowledge that all that's happened is absolutely\h
necessary it would happen the same way every time

899
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:57,900
that's I mean to put it in another way it's a\h
means of maintaining a sort of mental or emotional\h\h

900
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:05,460
cleanliness because the most dangerous thing for\h
the spirit the most corrupting influence possible\h\h

901
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:11,940
is the influence of resentment that's the feeling\h
one gets when one wishes to take revenge to pay\h\h

902
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:21,900
back harm that one that one has experienced right\h
but you cannot do so right that's when resentment\h\h

903
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:27,420
arises is when you want to respond or pay\h
someone kind but you don't have the power\h\h

904
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:33,840
this is driven by Will To Power as much as\h
anything else but this is a negative feedback\h\h

905
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:40,620
loop type of pattern because this feeling it\h
turns one's will in a counterproductive Direction\h\h

906
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:48,900
it's corrosive to the soul the individual suffers\h
greatly from it and resentment's not aimed at\h\h

907
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:54,720
creating anything or at bringing anything forth\h
It's solely aimed at destroying it's externally\h\h

908
01:40:54,720 --> 01:41:02,340
directed and it's negative in its orientation and\h
so a life lived in service to resentment is very\h\h

909
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:09,180
useful in providing one of many counter examples\h
for us to what the good life might be and or a\h\h

910
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:13,800
counter example of how to facilitate the good life\h
the good life is the opposite of a resentful life\h\h

911
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:21,600
now just to clear or a caveat when we're\h
talking about Justice there's another kind\h\h

912
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:26,580
of Justice which Nietzsche argues in human\h
all to human originated amongst the noble\h\h

913
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:31,800
classes of society the warrior aristocracies\h
of old would strike agreements with one another\h\h

914
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:37,800
based on the perception of relatively equal\h
strength between two parties that's how they\h\h

915
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:45,420
establish the concept of Rights of certain\h
respect or certain things do to all parties\h\h

916
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:53,160
the basis of justice and such a perspective it's\h
the real it's based on the reality that if there\h\h

917
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:59,580
were a conflict between the party's Mutual injury\h
or death might occur and so all parties must be\h\h

918
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:05,880
treated fairly their rights must be respected\h
but it's out of that fundamental Power Balance\h\h

919
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:16,200
furthermore if one amongst these parties is\h
slighted one does actually possess the ability\h\h

920
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:23,700
to repay the slight and if one is given a gift one\h
incurs an obligation to repay that gift because\h\h

921
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:28,860
um you know would be expected that you also would\h
have that ability it's the whole gift-giving\h\h

922
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:33,600
culture among the nobility that we see uh across\h
the world particularly in China for example\h\h

923
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:43,680
the same happens if for example somebody of this\h
type of noble mindset is shown Mercy out of Good\h\h

924
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:48,600
Will Mutual Goodwill they ought to return the\h
favor with leniency in the future right this\h\h

925
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:53,040
is the Justice of the warrior Aristocrats of\h
antiquity balancing the scales between multiple\h\h

926
01:42:53,040 --> 01:43:03,540
parties who respect one another's rights out of a\h
mutual respect for each other's power and so when\h\h

927
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:10,680
that when we contrast Justice and the way Plato's\h
talking about it uh against Nietzsche's virtues

928
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:17,640
Justice is not a niche in virtue because\h
what justice has come to mean has become\h\h

929
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:22,800
so foreign from that original concept\h
of justice that what it now signifies\h\h

930
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:27,420
is almost entirely synonymous with the\h
Revenge seeking of a grieved people

931
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:36,480
um in fact Justice as a virtue to Nietzsche\h
if he were to include that it would resemble\h\h

932
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:40,620
something more like the willingness to back\h
up your words with your deeds and the power\h\h

933
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:47,040
to rebalance the scales when they're unbalanced\h
um fairness in a mutual agreement among equals\h\h

934
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:52,920
and thus we see a healthy Justice portrayed as the\h
product of an aristocracy and an unhealthy Justice\h\h

935
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:59,280
portrayed as the product of the weak and that\h
this is a key to decoding many of the puzzles of\h\h

936
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:04,800
nietzscheon virtue ethics we might call it that\h
that it's not power that corrupts but weakness\h\h

937
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:10,260
that it's the weak person lacking in\h
power who will use any means to get it\h\h

938
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:18,720
who will become resentful and destructive one\h
therefore should distrust the weak and should\h\h

939
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:25,440
also avoid allowing oneself to become weak at all\h
costs if for no other reason that a weak person's\h\h

940
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:32,100
fate is to be corrupted by resentment as they\h
constantly find themselves imposed upon but the\h\h

941
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:38,040
power of others but unable to assert themselves\h
or to retaliate or to make their power felt

942
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:48,060
accepting the essential inequality of Life\h
the Injustice of life which is all implied\h\h

943
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:54,900
by what we've been talking about accepting all\h
of these uncomfortable realities is perhaps what\h\h

944
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:59,640
we might call another virtue of Nietzsche is\h
that he didn't explicitly list perhaps what we\h\h

945
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:06,360
could call hardness it's in one of zarathustra's\h
Parables that we get the simple Maxim become hard

946
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:15,060
um and this means become tough and it does mean\h
physically but also psychologically intellectually\h\h

947
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:22,560
um I mean that this would include the ability\h
to entertain painful dangerous or uncomfortable\h\h

948
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:28,680
ideas and perhaps the most uncomfortable for\h
us now uh looking at all this would be the\h\h

949
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:33,480
inevitable difference between human beings and\h
the implications of ascending and descending\h\h

950
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:40,140
life for society the implications of the nature\h
of life as contained in commanding and obeying\h\h

951
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:48,180
um that all human life has involved what\h
we would call according to our moral system\h\h

952
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:53,940
today immorality and exploitation and that\h
if you're prospering and flourishing today\h\h

953
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:59,220
your success is built on the\h
same kind of exploitation\h\h

954
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:05,700
the kind of toughness we're talking about involves\h
cutting off those false Paths of mentation\h\h

955
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:14,700
which allow you to deal with that brute reality\h
in a dishonest way such as by imposing moral guilt\h\h

956
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:21,720
upon yourself or upon all Society or by becoming\h
resentful or by entertaining utopian ideals that\h\h

957
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:28,080
violate Human Nature these are no longer open to\h
us and this conception of Nietzsche and virtue\h\h

958
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:35,400
for obvious reasons affirming life in this way\h
is not possible for everyone as we've said and so\h\h

959
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:41,640
Nietzsche's ultimate challenge is accepting life\h
to the point of asking for the same life to recur\h\h

960
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:46,980
eternally that said in Nietzsche's unpublished\h
notes to be a challenge that will enliven the\h\h

961
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:54,120
strong but break and paralyze the world weary it's\h
not a universal life philosophy and the good life\h\h

962
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:59,820
can't be reached by everyone although All Things\h
Considered it's not a particularly shocking Claim\h\h

963
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:03,720
about the good life now is it I mean going all the\h
way back to the Greek philosophers who gave us the\h\h

964
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:09,300
concept there's always been the fair warning\h
that virtue is not the province of all people\h\h

965
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:18,300
quite the opposite in fact I mean in some deep\h
way if virtue was possessed by all people it\h\h

966
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:24,300
would cease to become virtue a virtue is\h
at bottom equality it's a power and aspect\h\h

967
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:29,340
an ability that someone or something has and\h
like all things it's physiological in the most\h\h

968
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:35,820
fundamental sense and therefore not everyone can\h
possess the same ones and human beings differ so\h\h

969
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:40,200
much and their inclinations and even within the\h
range of possibilities that you might possess\h\h

970
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:45,840
there's no guarantee for Nietzsche that any course\h
of action or set of intentions will bring you to\h\h

971
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:53,160
the good life it's just not the property of the\h
common person but in his affirmative philosophy\h\h

972
01:47:53,160 --> 01:48:01,380
we see how he even affirms the the act of\h
aspiring to it right of of playing the dice\h\h

973
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:05,880
game for death and taking the risk for it even in\h
full knowledge that you probably won't attain it\h\h

974
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:15,420
that and in this way he brings his meta answer\h
to the question in line with his own aesthetic\h\h

975
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:22,260
um attempt to justify life that he's always sort\h
of that perspective he's always been coming from\h\h

976
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:32,460
of see the Beauty and the tragedy right and\h
so it's a self-overcoming starts with that\h\h

977
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:38,940
feeling he talks about his orthostra of a great\h
contempt great dissatisfaction with oneself\h\h

978
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:43,320
and the willingness to endure\h
real dangers and real suffering\h\h

979
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:52,380
um because that's what's needed to get out of\h
wretched self-complacency and just like the dancer\h\h

980
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:57,240
on the tightrope this in itself is laudable\h
for Nietzsche even if you fall off the Rope

981
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:06,480
and so let's talk about falling off the Rope the\h
final question I raised uh the final aspect we\h\h

982
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:12,420
broke the question of the meaning of life into\h
was the question of how we confront death and\h\h

983
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:20,580
Nietzsche gives us a pretty straightforward answer\h
and Beyond Good and Evil 96 quote one should\h\h

984
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:27,960
part from life as Odysseus parted from nausicaa\h
blessing it rather than in love with it end quote

985
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:36,900
now some have suggested that Odysseus may actually\h
have been in love with nausicaa even if this was\h\h

986
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:42,480
unrequited love I mean nasik is a beautiful\h
young woman Odysseus meets on his travels while\h\h

987
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:49,740
Shipwrecked and she's so beautiful that Odysseus\h
compares her to a goddess and uh you know the the\h\h

988
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:54,420
two of them seem to have feelings for one another\h
but when the time comes from Odysseus did apart\h\h

989
01:49:54,420 --> 01:50:02,940
he leaves her out of necessity right and so that's\h
what Nietzsche is talking about I mean he presents\h\h

990
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:10,200
his ideal attitude is of celebrating and\h
being grateful being grateful for having been\h\h

991
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:17,220
graced without encounter by Beauty right but\h
not becoming despondent and melancholic by\h\h

992
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:25,500
having depart from this experience but doing so\h
uh voluntarily um and with uh you know ease and\h\h

993
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:32,280
so this expresses an attitude that is totally\h
commensurate with people who in some ways their\h\h

994
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:38,100
attitude is an antipode of Nietzsche but we\h
might consider the taoism of laoza or zhuanza\h\h

995
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:43,260
the image of the figure who loves\h
life but does not cling to life\h\h

996
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:51,720
because true love of Life involves a knowledge of\h
life's transformative and impermanent nature and\h\h

997
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:58,080
so the sage in his wisdom in taoism doesn't cling\h
to any particular forms or manifestations of life\h\h

998
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:05,280
Nietzsche puts this in perhaps a stronger way\h
in which he brings out a dichotomy between two\h\h

999
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:11,400
ways that we could think about death one way or\h
really ways we could think about mortality right\h\h

1000
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:16,500
so one way in which death is viewed in an\h
unhealthy Manner and then he talks about\h\h

1001
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:25,680
another way in which we regard death in a healthy\h
or life ascending manner quotes the certain\h\h

1002
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:33,300
Prospect of death could sweeten every life with a\h
precious and fragrant drop of levity and now you\h\h

1003
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:40,560
strange Apothecary Souls have turned it into an\h
ill-tasting Drop of Poison that makes the whole\h\h

1004
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:49,500
of Life repulsive quote so the inevitability\h
of death that we perceive in our mortality\h\h

1005
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:55,440
could either hang over our heads at all hours\h
like the Sword of Damocles letting this thought\h\h

1006
01:51:55,440 --> 01:52:00,720
intrude on us at all times and therefore look\h
ruin all the happiness and joy and fulfillment\h\h

1007
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:08,700
we might be able to have or we may why can't we\h
see it in more light-hearted terms as a natural\h\h

1008
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:18,240
um something which we take in good humor which\h
allows us to keep our life in perspective and\h\h

1009
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:27,000
all the events of life and perspective um to see\h
The Comedy of the misplaced importance we have\h\h

1010
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:35,100
like the trivia Trivium of our lives right um\h
you could see death as the into the play that\h\h

1011
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:39,000
reveals our life's meaning to us that might\h
be like another way we could look at it right\h\h

1012
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:45,660
um the Insight that a Perpetual existence would\h
actually be rather torturous that could be another\h\h

1013
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:52,380
um like way we could look at it but some limit\h
to life some framing some finitude creates the\h\h

1014
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:58,740
horizons within which we can actually have\h
a distinct different individual existence\h\h

1015
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:02,820
and that it's like through\h
these limitations that we have\h\h

1016
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:07,140
a narrative making our subjective experience\h
possible this is all found with infinitude\h\h

1017
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:13,560
and um I mean however we want to look at it\h
once we accept that life really needs to have\h\h

1018
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:20,220
some finitude at that point is life long is life\h
short I mean who can say and I stay in some time\h\h

1019
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:29,760
life can't last forever in order for it to be\h
life so let's let the inevitable end serve as that\h\h

1020
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:35,040
motivation to sweeten every moment let\h
it be a drop of Honey on everything right\h\h

1021
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:40,620
there was a sorry to go Eastern again but I just\h
thought of this there's a zen master who wrote a\h\h

1022
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:47,100
poem I'll give sort of the uh the paraphrasing\h
translation from Zen flesh's and Bones it's\h\h

1023
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:55,800
like uh quote this day will never come again\h
each moment is like a precious gem end quote\h\h

1024
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:03,900
the attitude given in this poem it the kind\h
of attitude that colors our whole life and the\h\h

1025
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:09,420
whole of our experience when we reflect on the\h
finitude of life with this nietzschean Outlook\h\h

1026
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:19,680
and he's simply saying um you know maybe this\h
is one way in which we should call to mind the\h\h

1027
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:26,280
contingency of all interpretations and just\h
consider that the dreary and pessimistic view\h\h

1028
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:36,720
of uh life and its finitude is not by any means\h
the obvious default perspective and that we have\h\h

1029
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:42,840
examples of people like Odysseus or the Taoist\h
sages as I just brought up who people who are\h\h

1030
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:50,760
able to bless life without um without clinging\h
to it right and that perhaps the and for someone\h\h

1031
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:56,400
like myself the knowledge of death and the\h
finitude of life is a very motivating thing

1032
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:04,920
we're going to look at a final Nietzsche quote\h
today and it provides the best that I think most\h\h

1033
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:10,140
Innovative response to the troubling awareness of\h
our own mortality and that is don't think about it\h\h

1034
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:17,940
that's funny because you know the philosophical\h
types we always think we have to have some sort\h\h

1035
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:22,980
of answer to everything right a philosophical\h
position on every issue and mortality\h\h

1036
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:29,820
you know our own death it's one of those things\h
that the intellect can't answer you can't think\h\h

1037
01:55:29,820 --> 01:55:35,460
your way out of death comes to everyone and no\h
one knows what happens and even if we accept\h\h

1038
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:40,920
the materialist account that Consciousness\h
simply ends we can't conceive of not being\h\h

1039
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:45,960
beyond our experience no matter what it is\h
and it must remain beyond our experience\h\h

1040
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:52,920
and we so we just cannot comprehend it and\h
it's coming to everyone and so naturally\h\h

1041
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:56,580
become very fixated on this and disturbed by it\h\h

1042
01:55:57,420 --> 01:56:02,040
and like come to believe that before you face\h
that moment the moment of death the dissolution\h\h

1043
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:07,020
of Consciousness or passing on to the other world\h
or whatever you might think happens that they have\h\h

1044
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:13,320
to you know quote unquote figure it all out first\h
right we have to do something before we meet death\h\h

1045
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:17,040
to be ready for it that will make a difference\h
whether we've made our peace with it or not\h\h

1046
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:24,300
but in reality I think we all know deep down\h
that it doesn't really matter what level of\h\h

1047
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:29,100
an intellectual progress we've made in\h
grappling with or understanding death\h\h

1048
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:36,600
um because you you're not going to get there\h
um you're not going to understand it because\h\h

1049
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:40,140
it's beyond you and it's going to come\h
when it comes and there's no guarantee\h\h

1050
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:43,620
you'll get your time to work it all out\h
before it does I mean we don't have the\h\h

1051
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:52,440
the privilege of Jorge Luis Borges his character\h
in the story the uh the the secret Miracle he's a\h\h

1052
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:57,900
uh playwright who's about to be shot and\h
he begs God for the time to finish his\h\h

1053
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:02,160
play and time freezes and the playwright's\h
able to mentally think out everything and\h\h

1054
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:08,040
um you know like he finishes his whole play\h
he finishes all his great his magnum opus in\h\h

1055
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:12,840
the moment before the bullet hits his brain a\h
moment that lasts he allows it to last for like\h\h

1056
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:19,740
like hundreds of years if I recall correctly\h
so um you know unless you find yourself in the\h\h

1057
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:23,760
Twilight Zone or in a magical realist short\h
story that isn't usually how it all works\h\h

1058
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:30,540
so this is one of my favorite um Nietzsche\h
passages he argues against our philosophical\h\h

1059
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:36,540
inclinations and as elitists as Nietzsche can be\h
and we've discussed a lot of that in this episode\h\h

1060
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:41,460
he has his moments where he can take a step\h
back to admire or pay his respect to the\h\h

1061
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:47,040
average person and in this aphorism Nietzsche\h
for my read of it seems to be people watching\h\h

1062
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:51,240
I get that impression that that's what he's\h
doing when he had the idea for the aphorism\h\h

1063
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:58,440
and this is from the gay science\h
book for Section 278 quote

1064
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:07,260
the thought of death living in the midst\h
of this jumble of little Lanes needs and\h\h

1065
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:13,800
voices gives me a Melancholy happiness\h
how much enjoyment impatience and desire\h\h

1066
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:18,120
how much thirsty life and drunkenness\h
of Life comes to light every moment\h\h

1067
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:24,120
and yet silence will soon descend on all\h
these noisy living life-thirsty people\h\h

1068
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:30,180
how his shadow stands even now behind\h
everyone as his dark fellow Traveler\h\h

1069
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:35,940
it is always like the last moment before\h
the departure of an immigrant ship\h\h

1070
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:41,520
people have more to say to each other than ever\h
the hour is late and the ocean and its desolate\h\h

1071
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:48,060
silence are waiting impatiently behind all of\h
this noise so Covetous and certain of their prey\h\h

1072
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:54,600
and all and every one of them suppose that\h
heretofore was little or nothing while the\h\h

1073
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:59,400
near future is everything and that is the\h
reason for all of this haste this clamor\h\h

1074
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:05,340
this outshouting and overreaching each other\h
everyone wants to be the first in this future\h\h

1075
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:12,000
and yet death and deathly silence alone are\h
certain and common to all in this future\h\h

1076
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:19,920
how strange it is that this sole certainty\h
and common element makes almost no impression\h\h

1077
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:25,080
on people and that nothing is further from\h
their minds than the feeling that they form\h\h

1078
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:31,560
a Brotherhood of death it makes me happy that men\h
do not want at all to think the thought of death\h\h

1079
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:36,600
I should like very much to do something\h
that would make the thought of life\h\h

1080
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:47,760
even a hundred times more appealing to them\h
quote so as a final word my personal advice\h\h

1081
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:54,480
to agree with Nietzsche is don't spoil\h
your high moments thinking about the end\h\h

1082
01:59:56,040 --> 02:00:02,100
this ties in into Nietzsche's critique of\h
pity which we've only briefly touched on\h\h

1083
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:08,280
here but about how fixating on cruelty happening\h
elsewhere suffering happening to other people\h\h

1084
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:17,160
it only serves to infect us with that suffering\h
we've been enculturated to think that what goes\h\h

1085
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:22,440
up must come down to always keep in mind\h
that we'll be laid low and into dust one day\h\h

1086
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:31,860
and because of this it that feeds right\h
into the feeling that we feel we still have\h\h

1087
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:36,180
to worry about having the correct thing\h
in our hearts by the time we Face death\h\h

1088
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:42,660
and the extent to which we have that feeling still\h
is the extent to which we are still Christian\h\h

1089
02:00:44,580 --> 02:00:49,500
the thought of death is a heavy weighty thought\h
it might be important to pick up that weight\h\h

1090
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:56,160
and lift it from time to time especially for the\h
hyperboreans out there but we can't let it become\h\h

1091
02:00:57,060 --> 02:01:07,560
a heavyweight a burden right and so to the extent\h
that the common man is relatively speaking freed\h\h

1092
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:13,620
from the heavy existential concerns that plague\h
philosophers Nietzsche says he's better off for it\h\h

1093
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:20,340
and we should never forget that our concern with\h
such things as a handicap something deleterious to\h\h

1094
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:27,600
life the meaning of life is not found by saddling\h
ourselves with burdens or by making things Grave\h\h

1095
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:34,140
and serious the thought of death is useful so\h
long as it can enrich our lives sweeten Our Lives\h\h

1096
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:40,560
make us appreciate that our moments are precious\h
gems but while we are living those moments the\h\h

1097
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:45,240
point is to become absorbed and engaged in\h
the here and now to live in such a way that\h\h

1098
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:51,660
you fall in love with life and ideally a\h
kind of mature love like that of laozza or\h\h

1099
02:01:51,660 --> 02:01:58,560
Odysseus or better yet that you live with such\h
Vigor and Zeal that you leave behind a stamp\h\h

1100
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:06,600
upon the world like Gerta or Napoleon to live with\h
the kind of creative innocent sincerity described\h\h

1101
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:13,860
by Nietzsche and the most cheerful and most\h
elevated moments in his work to live in such a\h\h

1102
02:02:13,860 --> 02:02:19,980
way that when you come to the end of your life you\h
know that you would gladly do it all over again\h\h

1103
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:29,280
the attitude that we should have when facing death\h
is as Nietzsche describes quoting from the Greeks\h\h

1104
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:36,600
someone who says was that life well then once more
