1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,560
What is the meaning of life?

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,080
Does it truly exist?

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,680
Throughout our lives,
we often find ourselves pondering:\h\h

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,000
What is the meaning of life?
Why was I born?\h

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,560
Is our existence merely the result of a\h
fleeting attraction between two individuals,\h

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,840
or are we part of some longer-term\h
commitments made by others?\h

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,440
Such questions can inspire us to seek\h
answers and find meaning in life,\h

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,000
or they can lead to depression\h
when satisfactory answers elude us.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,760
For thousands of years, astrology has\h
also attempted to provide answers to\h\h

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,560
these personal queries based on the date and\h
time of one's birth. Various religions and\h\h

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:57,760
philosophies have similarly strived to provide\h
fulfilling answers to these profound questions.

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,880
Chapter 1: What is the Meaning of Life?

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,520
The concept of "meaning" is\h
irrelevant to life itself.

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,040
Life is neither meaningful nor meaningless.

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Yet, for centuries, human minds have been\h\h

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,360
conditioned to believe that life\h
holds some grand significance.

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,640
All such meanings are arbitrary.
Thus, in this century,\h\h

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,480
for the first time in human history,
the question, "What is the meaning of life?"

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,800
has become one of the most pivotal\h
questions. This is because all the\h\h

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:40,240
old deceits have been exposed. Life is said\h
to have meaning if there is a God. Life is\h\h

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,640
meaningful if there is an afterlife. Life\h
is meaningful because churches, synagogues,\h\h

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,520
temples, and mosques continually hammer\h
this idea into people's minds. A certain\h\h

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,920
maturity has come to humanity, not to\h
everyone, but to a very small minority.

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,800
I want you to remember five significant names.\h
First is Soren Kierkegaard. He was the first to\h\h

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:12,360
raise this question and was condemned globally\h
because even asking it sparked doubt in people.\h\h

26
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,560
No one had ever dared to ask - What is the\h
meaning of life? Even atheists, who denied God,\h\h

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,160
denied an afterlife, denied the existence\h
of the soul - even they never questioned the\h\h

28
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:32,000
meaning of life. They said, "To eat, drink, and\h
be merry" - that is the meaning of life. To them,\h\h

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,320
it was clear that these pleasures - "to eat,\h
drink, and be merry" - encapsulated all of life.\h\h

30
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:46,080
But Soren Kierkegaard delved deeper into this\h
question. Unknowingly, he sparked a movement:\h\h

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,280
existentialism. Following him were four\h
other names: Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers,\h\h

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,840
Gabriel Marcel, and last but not least,\h
arguably the most important, Jean-Paul Sartre.\h\h

33
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,200
These individuals continued to hammer into the\h
intellect of the world: life is meaningless.

34
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,280
Now, anyone with any sort of intelligence\h
will eventually confront this question,\h

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,280
and he must find a way to face it.
I do not agree with these five great\h\h

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,960
philosophers, but I hold great respect\h
for them. They were courageous because\h\h

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,240
once you remove meaning from life,\h
religion disappears, for so far,\h\h

38
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,480
religion has been nothing but an effort to\h
inject meaning into your life: to fill it so\h\h

39
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,440
you do not feel empty; to surround you with\h
God and angels so you do not feel alone...\h

40
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,080
You do not go to churches, synagogues,\h
and temples without reason.

41
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,800
Existence is merely a challenge for creativity.

42
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,160
Throughout millennia, humans haven't bowed to\h
priests without reason. They gained something\h\h

43
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:03,080
in return. Indeed, they were exploited, but\h
even within that exploitation, they found a\h\h

44
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:11,000
measure of comfort. They weren't alone; they were\h
cared for. Life was not pointless—it held great,\h\h

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,200
spiritual, mysterious, and profound\h
meaning... so vast and deep that it\h\h

46
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,840
was beyond your intellect to grasp. Yet, most\h
people, ninety-nine percent, aren't troubled\h\h

47
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:30,120
by the question. How could they be? They easily\h
find comfort in a past that is not dead to them.

48
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,480
The meanings that religious figures have\h
instilled in human life are arbitrary.

49
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,280
These individuals expose the arbitrariness\h
of the meanings given by religion—but that\h\h

50
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,640
does not imply that life is meaningless. It\h
simply means that the meanings infused into\h\h

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:55,320
life so far have been found invalid: God is not\h
the meaning of life. Life after death is not the\h\h

52
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:03,800
meaning of life. Jesus is not the meaning of life.\h
However, that doesn’t mean life lacks meaning.

53
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,240
Because you thought these were the meanings\h
of life, when they suddenly collapse,\h\h

54
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,520
you gravitate toward the extreme\h
opposite idea of meaninglessness.

55
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Remember this perspective. Be existential.\h
I want to tell you that life is not about\h\h

56
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,280
having meaning or not having meaning. The\h
question is irrelevant. Life is an opportunity,\h\h

57
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,320
a potential unfolding. It depends on what\h
you make of it. It depends on what meaning,\h\h

58
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:40,280
colors, songs, poetry, dances you bring\h
to it. Life is a creative challenge.

59
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,880
The beauty is that it doesn't have a fixed\h
meaning, or else there would be no challenge\h\h

60
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,320
at all. It would just be a given: you are\h
born, and the meaning of life is handed to you,\h\h

61
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,240
and you carry it throughout your life;\h
that is your life's meaning. No, existence\h\h

62
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:09,200
is deeper than any meaning. Existence\h
is merely a challenge for creativity.\h

00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:19,760
Chapter 2. Ten Answers for a Meaningful Life.
From the Buddhist Perspective of Dr. B. Alan\h\h

64
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,040
Wallace, a renowned scholar and practitioner\h
of Buddhism in the United States. He directs\h\h

65
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,840
long-term programs at the Santa Barbara\h
Institute and the University of California,\h\h

66
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:40,080
Los Angeles, studying the relationship\h
between meditation and happiness.

67
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:47,760
The first question: What is genuine happiness?

68
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,120
I think the term "human flourishing" is more\h
accurate, as it derives from the Greek word\h\h

69
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,520
eudaimonia. Translating it as genuine happiness\h
works, but "flourishing" is more precise.\h

70
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:08,200
And what does this happiness\h
bring us? – A meaningful life.

71
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,700
So, what makes our lives meaningful?

72
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:20,200
- In my view, it must be about\h
each day, not just a lifetime.

73
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:27,720
I see four elements for a happy day. First, have\h
I lived this day with ethical discipline? Here,\h\h

74
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,640
I'm referring to the fundamental moral\h
principles in Buddhism, like not harming others,\h\h

75
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:40,440
not speaking harshly, and practicing compassion\h
and mindfulness. The second element is feeling\h\h

76
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,880
happiness rather than suffering. I've met\h
practitioners who always exude a peace in their\h\h

77
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:54,480
steps, in how they handle life's challenges and\h
interact with others. The third is seeking truth,\h\h

78
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:01,680
wanting to see and understand the reality, the\h
true nature of oneself and life. And one can do\h\h

79
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:09,720
all these while sitting quietly in a small room.\h
But no one is isolated or independent. Hence,\h\h

80
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,440
to have a happy life, we must answer the\h
fourth question, "What do I bring to life?"

81
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,240
If I can look back on a day in my life and\h
see these four elements—ethical discipline,\h\h

82
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,680
happiness, truth, and concern for\h
others—I can say, "I am a happy person."\h

83
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,440
Happiness does not depend on our bank\h
account, our spouse's attitude, our job,\h\h

84
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:44,720
or our salary. We can live a life full of meaning,\h
even if we had only ten minutes left to live.\h

85
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:55,640
Question: The four elements you mentioned don't\h
include health; isn't health a crucial factor?\h

86
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:02,080
Actually, no! One of my students has a rare\h
and severe disease, requiring daily hospital\h\h

87
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,480
visits and medication for the rest of his\h
life. One might think, "What a pitiful and\h\h

88
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,640
painful situation!" But when I met him the other\h
day, he told me, "Allen, I am flourishing!" And\h\h

89
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,440
I genuinely felt that he was. He has found\h
a way to navigate within his limitations,\h\h

90
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:28,160
under the conditions that exist for him. His\h
spirit is clear. He reads, he writes, he grows.\h\h

91
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,760
He meditates daily and even teaches meditation\h
to other terminally ill patients in the hospital.\h

92
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:43,560
He lives a very full and meaningful life,\h
and he can honestly say he is happy.\h

93
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:53,360
Question: What is his secret?
He does not seek happiness from external sources.\h\h

94
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,240
When we rely on status, money, or our spouses to\h
bring us happiness, we will never be truly happy\h\h

95
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,880
because we are depending on things that are not\h
ours. Moreover, others around us also vie for the\h\h

96
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:17,560
same money and status, which are not abundantly\h
available for everyone. That's the sad reality.

97
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,600
What about the good news?

98
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,720
The great news is that genuine happiness is not\h
sold in the marketplace, where it can be bought\h\h

99
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,760
if one has the money. One of the least discovered\h
secrets is that the happiness we seek in high\h\h

100
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,880
positions, in a perfect spouse, in well-behaved\h
children, in good health, in a secure job,\h\h

101
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:47,160
in security, in looking good—all of that is always\h
available within us, just waiting to be connected\h\h

102
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,560
with. Instead of searching externally,\h
why not turn inward and see what happens!\h

103
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,600
This does not mean that you should not\h
marry, buy a car, or find a satisfying job.\h\h

104
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,800
But I want to emphasize that if you are happy,\h
that happiness does not depend on external factors\h\h

105
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:16,280
because they are not within your control.
Question: Everyone says money and status\h\h

106
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:24,120
don't bring happiness, but how\h
many actually live that way?\h

107
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,280
The truth is, deep down, we don't really believe\h
it. We continue to search outside ourselves,\h\h

108
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:37,400
chasing what we think will make us happy—fame,\h
a high position, love, financial and emotional\h\h

109
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:44,120
security. We lack hope and belief in a\h
true form of happiness. We tell ourselves,\h\h

110
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,280
"Maybe true happiness doesn't exist; it's just\h
nice to talk about. I'm content with an iPod or\h\h

111
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,680
a big-screen TV; that's enough happiness for\h
me." Or some might say, "Let's not talk about\h\h

112
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:05,760
happiness; just getting through today is tough\h
enough!" I think they are truly to be pitied.

113
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,600
Is that a form of despair?
- It's a state where our mind\h\h

114
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,600
no longer has space; we lose a broader\h
perspective. I think of loving-kindness,\h\h

115
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,280
metta. When practicing loving-kindness,\h
we start with loving ourselves. But this\h\h

116
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,440
doesn't mean, "What job is best for me?\h
How much salary do I deserve?" Rather,\h\h

117
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,920
it's about, "How can I flourish?" "How\h
should I live to be happy, peaceful,\h\h

118
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:42,920
and meaningful?" Then, we expand that outlook:\h
"How can people suffering find real happiness?"

119
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,720
Shantideva said, "Those who seek to\h
escape from suffering plunge into\h\h

120
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,200
suffering. Because they desire happiness, they\h
unwittingly destroy the happiness they have,\h\h

121
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,520
treating it as an enemy." Why\h
is that? Why do so few choose\h\h

122
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,900
the path of spiritual practice if\h
it could bring genuine happiness?

123
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,600
- The real answer is that we don't\h
actually know what can bring us true\h\h

124
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,160
happiness. It will take a long time and\h
painful experiences before we wake up\h\h

125
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,320
and recognize what is happening. We are\h
tied to images and ideas in our heads:\h\h

126
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,720
"If only my spouse were like this, if only I had\h
that job, that amount of money, looked like this,\h\h

127
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,800
had this kind of health... then I would\h
be happy." But these are mere illusions.\h

128
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,200
We all know people who have perfect health,\h
wealth, status, and abundant love... yet they\h\h

129
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,440
still carry a lot of pain. These people are our\h
teachers because they teach us a significant\h\h

130
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:56,240
lesson. They show us that you can win life's grand\h
lottery yet still lose the lottery of happiness.\h

131
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,600
When you talk about "genuine\h
happiness," do you mean to suggest\h\h

132
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:11,560
that there are other types of happiness in life?
- Exactly! We often mistake what the Buddha called\h\h

133
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:18,560
the "Eight Worldly Winds"—the fluctuations of\h
life—for happiness. These Eight Winds are the\h\h

134
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,320
desires to prosper but not decline, to experience\h
pleasure but not pain, to receive praise but\h\h

135
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:32,480
not criticism, to gain fame but not obscurity.\h
However, we must remember this: there is nothing\h\h

136
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,520
inherently wrong with being wealthy, joyful,\h
praised, and renowned. Take wealth, for example:\h\h

137
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,480
if you have a new coat, does discarding it make\h
you a better person? Obviously not! There's\h\h

138
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,520
nothing wrong with having things, but it’s a grave\h
error to believe that they can bring happiness.

139
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,840
True happiness is about connecting with the root\h
of happiness, not just grasping at elements that\h\h

140
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:04,200
may or may not manufacture happiness. The\h
difference between practicing and chasing\h\h

141
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,760
after the Eight Worldly Winds lies right there.\h
Some people practice meditation with the goal\h\h

142
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:17,120
of satisfying these desires, seeking a kind of\h
pleasure in meditation. They treat meditation\h\h

143
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,080
like a cup of coffee, a jog, or a massage. While\h
there's nothing wrong with that, it's quite\h\h

144
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:28,960
limited. Meditation can do something a massage\h
can't: it can heal the wounds within our minds.\h

145
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,720
This path to happiness seems to require a lot of\h
faith and letting go. It sounds a bit scary. What\h\h

146
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:50,720
will I become if I let go of all external things?
You don’t need to plunge into deep waters right\h\h

147
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,400
away. It’s like saying one day, "This world is a\h
house on fire, full of suffering. I will renounce\h\h

148
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,920
everything to seek peace in the Buddhist\h
teachings." Then, after a few days, weeks,\h\h

149
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:12,000
or at best months, you might think, "Hey, this\h
practice doesn’t seem as peaceful or happy as\h\h

150
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,880
they said. Where’s my iPod, my TV, or my old\h
girlfriend? Does anyone know where they went?"

151
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,360
So, the issue is not about suddenly dropping\h
all life's pleasures, the worldly winds,\h\h

152
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,640
and only practicing profound Buddhist\h
teachings. It’s like teaching a child to swim;\h\h

153
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,520
you don’t throw them into the deep end\h
and see what happens! You start shallow,\h\h

154
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,240
getting them used to the water. Similarly,\h
start by meditating a bit each morning and\h\h

155
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,200
evening. See how it affects your\h
day. Gradually, you will taste\h\h

156
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,640
the flavor of the teachings. You might find it\h
interesting! You feel happier. Not just happier,\h\h

157
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:00,840
but you also gain some virtue. You see reality\h
more clearly. And if you wish, you can now help\h\h

158
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,640
others and the world more effectively through\h
your practice. You actually feel happier and\h\h

159
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,160
you’ll grow more confident in the path you’re\h
on. The Eight Worldly Winds will still blow;\h\h

160
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:23,400
they continue to come and go. They're still there,\h
but now you can use them to further your practice.\h

161
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,240
Final question: Can we then conclude that the path\h
of Buddha's practice is not just for enlightenment\h\h

162
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:37,720
under the Bodhi tree but also\h
for bringing happiness to others?\h

163
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,320
I believe that Buddha experienced something\h
profound and extraordinary under the Bodhi tree.\h\h

164
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,280
However, he was also aware that this enlightenment\h
would not be fully meaningful if he did not share\h\h

165
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:56,000
it with others. Enlightenment is not about\h
self-contentment—"Now I'm fine. All done,\h\h

166
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,480
I can rest." The world was transformed by Buddha's\h
presence in it. But it wasn't the 49 days he spent\h\h

167
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,600
under the Bodhi tree that transformed the\h
world; it was the 45 years that followed,\h\h

168
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,160
during which Buddha met and engaged with the\h
poor, kings, warriors, beggars... sharing his\h\h

169
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,840
enlightenment with everyone he encountered.
Therefore, returning to the four elements I\h\h

170
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:29,240
mentioned earlier, sitting under the Bodhi tree,\h
Buddha embodied the first three elements: virtue,\h\h

171
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:36,480
happiness, and truth. And over the following 45\h
years, he developed the fourth element, bringing\h\h

172
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:44,440
happiness into life. In my view, Buddha is the\h
epitome of a life full of happiness and meaning.

173
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,800
But I must also warn you, sometimes\h
to access that genuine happiness,\h\h

174
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:57,200
you might need to momentarily set\h
aside your iPhone and Smart TV!
