1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,700
People nowadays often say, sometimes in a sad way, other times more aggressively and cynically,

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,200
that life just has no meaning.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,340
Two reasons are often given for this.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,480
The first has to do with religion.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,580
Once upon a time, so the story goes, life had a clear meaning given to us by God;

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,200
it was about worshiping him,

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,240
but as religious belief has declined, not only has God supposedly died,

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,860
but along with him, the meaning he once guaranteed.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,420
Modern science is the second course at the current
crisis of meaning. Scientists tell us that

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:34,969
life

11
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:38,309
which emerged from a random interplay
of chemicals and gases

12
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,820
does have a meaning but it's of a rather bleak, relentless, and narrow sort.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,329
For humans as for all other living
things like amoeba

14
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:50,780
the meaning of life is survival and the
propagation of one's genetic material

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,610
It sounds very true and at the same time
distinctly futile and melancholy.

16
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,910
Here we want to argue as follows: to wonder
about the meaning of life

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,369
is an extremely important activity, life
does have substantial meaning

18
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:07,770
And there are in fact a range of
practical steps we can take

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,470
to ensure we end up leading lives of
maximal meaningfulness.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,340
We should stop by saying
that there is no meaning in life

21
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,850
outside of that which we can find by
ourselves as a species

22
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,369
there isn't any kind of objective
meaning written in the stars

23
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:27,623
in a holy book or in sequences of DNA.
What seems to prompt people to complain

24
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,869
that life lacks meaning

25
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:33,871
are particular varieties of unhappiness. Let's
consider some central examples

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,740
you're in a relationship but the
intensity you experienced at the start

27
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,579
is long gone

28
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,049
you don't seem to talk about anything
important anymore or share vulnerable

29
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:43,579
feelings and ideas.

30
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:47,700
It feels, as you put it, meaningless or
else you're single and though you have

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,530
many friends

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,720
every time you see them the conversation
seems shallow and trivial

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,030
or you're at University studying for a
degree. You signed up for the course

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,659
in part because you often feel confused
about who you are and what you want

35
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,819
you thought that reading books and going
to lectures would shine a light on things,

36
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,000
but the topics of Darwin disconnected
from your confusion.

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,700
You complained that it feels meaningless.

38
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,590
Or you're working in a large profitable
company

39
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,720
and earning a decent sum every week, but the work doesn't seem in the grandeur scheme

40
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,470
important by which you mean two things: that you don't seem to be making any

41
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,400
great difference to anyone's life

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,680
and also that there's no profound part of you that you're able to bring to or

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,349
incorporate in your work;

44
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,900
it might as well be done by robots. From
these strands

45
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,060
we can start to extrapolate a theory of meaning.

46
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,519
Meaning is to be found in three
activities in particular

47
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,959
Communication; Understanding and Service

48
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,870
Let's look at communication first. We are, by nature

49
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,049
isolated creatures and it appears that
some of our most meaningful moments

50
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:53,709
are to do with instances of connection, with the lover for example

51
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,120
when we reveal our intimate physical and
psychological selves

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,610
when we form friendships with
substantial truths about our respective

53
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,819
lives can be shared

54
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:05,650
all on a journey to a new country when
we strike up a conversation with a

55
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,349
stranger

56
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:10,959
and feel a thrilling sense of victory over
linguistic and cultural barriers

57
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,359
then there's the meaning that emerges
via understanding

58
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:18,440
this is about the pleasure that can be
felt whenever we correct confusion and

59
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,739
puzzlement about ourselves or the world

60
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:23,859
we might be scientific researchers or
economists

61
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:28,040
poets or patients in psychotherapy. The
pleasure of our activities

62
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,280
stems from a common ability to map and
make sense of what was once

63
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,040
painfully unfamiliar and strange

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Thirdly, there is service, one of the most meaningful
things we can do

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,169
is to serve other people, to try to
improve their lives

66
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,169
either by alleviating sources of
suffering

67
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:49,220
or else by generating new sources of
pleasure

68
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,780
that includes medical professionals but
also people who bake cakes, write songs

69
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,830
or dance for a living

70
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,830
we're often told to think of ourselves
as inherently selfish

71
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,760
but some of the most meaningful moments
come when we can transcend our egos

72
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,900
and put ourselves at the service of
others or the planet

73
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,030
one should add that in order for
service to feel meaningful

74
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,650
it has to be in sync with our own native
sincere interests

75
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,989
it's a case of knowing enough about
ourselves to find a particular path to service.

76
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,389
Armed with such ideas, we can move
towards defining nothing less

77
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,950
than the meaning of life. The meaning of life
is to pursue human flourishing

78
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,389
through communication, understanding and
service.

79
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,630
We may not have meaningful lives yet but
it's central to affirm

80
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,220
that the concept of a meaningful life is
eminently plausible

81
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,520
and that it comprises elements that
can be clearly named

82
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,250
and gradually fought for.
