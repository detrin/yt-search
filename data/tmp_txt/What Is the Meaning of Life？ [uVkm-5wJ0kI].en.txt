people wonder what's the meaning of life
like what's it all about what's what
justifies the suffering and the misery
and all of that it's like well that's
what justifies it
is like you put yourself up against that
you think okay all with all of this
pushing against me how much can I push
back could I move the horror an inch
back with with all the strength that I
have at my disposal man and the answer
to that is yeah you can you
it makes you better with regards to
yourself but it also makes the world a
better place
