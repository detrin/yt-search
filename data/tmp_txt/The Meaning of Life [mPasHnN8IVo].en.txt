hey what do you think the meaning of
life is seriously bro you're asking me
I'm serious like we can't possibly put
on this Earth justifying meaning
throughout our entire s until we die why
not cuz that would be well that would
huh the way I see
it that's exactly what life is what
existentialism not silly to not know
anything at
all yet to still know at the end of the
day that you experienced it experienced
what laughter sadness happiness
anxiety life so life is the
experience you said it not
